The class is designed to handle HTTP requests and interactions with JavaScript runtime in a Blazor WebAssembly application.\r\n\r\nHere are the key components:\r\n\r\nNamespaces: The code imports several namespaces required for HTTP operations, JSON handling, state management, and JavaScript interop.\r\n\r\n1. System.Net\r\n2. System.Net.Http.Headers\r\n3. System.Net.Http.Json\r\n4. Checker.Models\r\n5. Checker.state\r\n6. Fluxor\r\n7. Microsoft.JSInterop\r\nNamespace Declaration: The FetchService class is declared within the Checker.Services namespace.\r\n\r\nClass Declaration: The FetchService class is declared as a public class.\r\n\r\nPrivate Fields:\r\n\r\n_httpClinet: A private readonly field of type HttpClient for making HTTP requests.\r\n\r\n_jsRuntime: A private readonly field of type IJSRuntime for interacting with JavaScript. \r\n\r\nConstructor: The constructor initializes the _httpClinet and _jsRuntime fields with the provided HttpClient and IJSRuntime instances.\r\n\r\n## Method\r\n\r\n### LoginAsync\r\n\r\nThis method handles user login by sending a POST request with the login model and returns a token.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic async Task<JsonModel> LoginAsync(LoginModel loginModel)\r\n{\r\n    var response = await _httpClinet.PostAsJsonAsync($\"{AppSettings.ApiBaseUrl}/creare-cont\", loginModel);\r\n    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();\r\n    var token = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<JsonModel>();\r\n    return token;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### SignUpAsync\r\nThis method handles user sign-up by sending a POST request with the sign-up model and returns a response model.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic async Task<SignUpResponseModel> SignUpAsync(SignUpModel signUpModel)\r\n{\r\n    var response = await _httpClinet.PostAsJsonAsync($\"{AppSettings.ApiBaseUrl}/inregistrare\", signUpModel);\r\n    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();\r\n    var result = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<SignUpResponseModel>();\r\n    return result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional Methods like\r\n\r\n### GetUserProfileAsync\r\n\r\nThis method retrieves the user's profile by sending a GET request.\r\n```C#\r\npublic async Task<UserProfileModel> GetUserProfileAsync(string token)\r\n{\r\n    var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, $\"{AppSettings.ApiBaseUrl}/profil\");\r\n    request.Headers.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue(\"Bearer\", token);\r\n    var response = await _httpClinet.SendAsync(request);\r\n    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();\r\n    return await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<UserProfileModel>();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### UpdateUserProfileAsync\r\n\r\nThis method updates the user's profile by sending a PUT request with the updated profile model.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic async Task<HttpResponseMessage> UpdateUserProfileAsync(UserProfileModel profileModel, string token)\r\n{\r\n    var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Put, $\"{AppSettings.ApiBaseUrl}/profil\");\r\n    request.Headers.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue(\"Bearer\", token);\r\n    request.Content = JsonContent.Create(profileModel);\r\n    return await _httpClinet.SendAsync(request);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe FetchService class provides a comprehensive set of methods for handling user authentication and profile management. These methods include logging in, signing up, retrieving user profiles, updating profiles, and logging out. Each method is designed to perform specific tasks by making appropriate HTTP requests or interacting with JavaScript, ensuring a clean and reusable service layer within the Blazor WebAssembly application.\r\n\r\n\r\n## State management\r\n\r\nThe state management in this code is implemented using the Fluxor library, which is a state management library for Blazor applications. The code defines reducers that handle specific actions to update the application's state.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's focus on the ProfileCardState and how is used in the context of state management with Fluxor.\r\n\r\n### ProfileCardState\r\nThe ProfileCardState likely represents the state of a user's profile card in the application. This state could include information such as the user's profile details, loading status, and any errors.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nProfileCardState Definition:\r\n\r\nThe ProfileCardState class is defined in the State.cs file. It includes properties like HomeAddress, Country, County, Occupation, FullName, Email, Image, and various social media links.\r\n```C#\r\npublic class ProfileCardState\r\n{\r\n    public string HomeAddress { get; set; }\r\n    public string Country { get; set; }\r\n    public string County { get; set; }\r\n    public string Occupation { get; set; }\r\n    public string FullName { get; set; }\r\n    public string Email { get; set; }\r\n    public byte[] Image { get; set; }\r\n    public string LinkedIn { get; set; }\r\n    public string FaceBook { get; set; }\r\n    public string GitHub { get; set; }\r\n    public string Instagram { get; set; }\r\n    public string Twitter { get; set; }\r\n    public string Youtube { get; set; }\r\n    public string Description { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public ProfileCardState(string homeAddress, string country, string county, string occupation, string fullname, string email, byte[] image, string linkedIn, string faceBook, string gitHub, string instagram, string twitter, string youtube, string description)\r\n    {\r\n        HomeAddress = homeAddress;\r\n        Country = country;\r\n        County = county;\r\n        Occupation = occupation;\r\n        Image = image;\r\n        FullName = fullname;\r\n        Email = email;\r\n        LinkedIn = linkedIn;\r\n        FaceBook = faceBook;\r\n        GitHub = gitHub;\r\n        Instagram = instagram;\r\n        Twitter = twitter;\r\n        Youtube = youtube;\r\n        Description = description;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public ProfileCardState() { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has constructors to initialize these properties, including a parameterless constructor for flexibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeature Initialization:\r\n\r\nThe ProfileCardFeature class, defined in the Feature.cs file, specifies the initial state of ProfileCardState with default values.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nusing Fluxor;\r\n\r\nnamespace Checker.state\r\n{\r\n    public class ProfileCardFeature : Feature<ProfileCardState>\r\n    {\r\n        public override string GetName() => \"ProfileCard\";\r\n\r\n        protected override ProfileCardState GetInitialState() =>\r\n            new ProfileCardState(\r\n                string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, new byte[0], \r\n                string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, \r\n                string.Empty\r\n            );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nReducers:\r\n\r\nThe ProfileCardReducer class, found in the Reducers.cs file, handles state changes. The ReduceProfileCard method updates the state based on the GetProfileCardState action by creating a new ProfileCardState with updated values.\r\n```C#\r\nusing Fluxor;\r\n\r\nnamespace Checker.state\r\n{\r\n    public static class ProfileCardReducer\r\n    {\r\n        [ReducerMethod]\r\n        public static ProfileCardState ReduceProfileCard(ProfileCardState state, GetProfileCardState action)\r\n        {\r\n            return new ProfileCardState(\r\n                action.State.HomeAddress,\r\n                action.State.Country,\r\n                action.State.County,\r\n                action.State.Occupation,\r\n                action.State.FullName,\r\n                action.State.Email,            \r\n                action.State.Image,\r\n                action.State.LinkedIn,\r\n                action.State.FaceBook,\r\n                action.State.GitHub,\r\n                action.State.Instagram,\r\n                action.State.Twitter,\r\n                action.State.Youtube,\r\n                action.State.Description\r\n            );\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage in Components:\r\n\r\nIn various Razor components like ProfileRender.razor, HomeRender.razor, and AdminRender.razor, the ProfileCardState is injected and used to display profile information.\r\nThese components fetch user data from the server and dispatch actions to update the state. For example, when the profile page is loaded, it checks the authentication token and fetches the user's profile data to update the state.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n@page \"/profile\"\r\n\r\n@using Checker.Pages.Message\r\n@using global::Checker.state\r\n@using global::Checker.Models \r\n@using global::Checker.Services\r\n@using global::Checker.features\r\n@using Fluxor\r\n@inject AuthenticationTocken authenticationtocken\r\n@inject IState<ProfileCardState> ProfileCardState\r\n\r\n@inject FetchService fetchService\r\n@inject IDispatcher Dispatcher\r\n\r\n@if(error == false){\r\n    @if(isLoading){\r\n        <BlazorChecking/>\r\n    } else if(tokenState){\r\n        <ProfileDom/>\r\n    }else{\r\n        <Restricted/>\r\n    }\r\n}else{\r\n    <BlazorError/>\r\n}\r\n\r\n@code{\r\n    bool isLoading = true;\r\n    bool error = false;\r\n    bool tokenState;\r\n    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()\r\n    {\r\n        tokenState = await authenticationtocken.Check();\r\n        \r\n        if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(ProfileCardState.Value.FullName)){\r\n            isLoading = false;\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        string tokenString = await authenticationtocken.GetTocken();\r\n        if(tokenState){\r\n            try{\r\n                var response = await fetchService.GetResponsSocialCard($\"{AppSettings.ApiBaseUrl}/get\", tokenString);\r\n                Dispatcher.Dispatch(new GetProfileCardState(response));\r\n                if(response != null){\r\n                    isLoading = false;\r\n                }else{\r\n                    throw new Exception(\"eroare\");\r\n                }\r\n            } catch (Exception) {\r\n                error = true;\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n        }else{\r\n            isLoading = false;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis setup ensures consistent management and updating of the profile information across the application using Fluxor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},"nextProject":{"slug":"quote","frontMatter":{"date":"2017-10-10","title":"Quote","lang":"Build with React","description":"This project is a standalone frontend application built with React, focusing on delivering a streamlined user experience.

It does not have a dedicated backend; instead, it relies on Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) for data storage and real-time functionality. Designed with a mobile-first approach, the application prioritizes optimization for mobile devices, providing core features inspired by Facebook, such as sharing posts and liking them.\r\n\r\n<div className=\"image columns-1 sm:columns-2 gap-8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n![React 02.](/images/project/01.jpg)\r\n![React 04.](/images/project/01-01.jpg)\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nFor data storage, the application uses a NoSQL Firebase database. User data, such as account creation information, is temporarily stored in the local session (e.g., localStorage or sessionStorage) and then sent to Firebase for permanent storage. Posts and other content-related data are retrieved from Firebase through API calls, often referred to as \"gates.\" These are then integrated into the app's state, which is managed using Redux, ensuring a consistent and efficient flow of information between components.\r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\nThe application incorporates modern technologies to achieve its functionality. While React serves as the framework for building the user interface, Sass is used for styling, offering modular and reusable designs. Redux is at the core of the app’s state management, enabling smooth synchronization of data such as posts, likes, and shares. Middleware like Redux Thunk facilitates handling asynchronous API calls to Firebase, ensuring organized and efficient state updates.\r\n\r\nThe user interactions within the app are intuitive and align with familiar patterns from social media platforms. For instance, users can share posts or like them, with these actions updating both the local state and Firebase in real-time. Account creation is straightforward, with user details initially stored locally before being validated and saved in Firebase. Posts and related interactions, once fetched, are synchronized with the Redux Store, making them readily accessible across various parts of the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redux Role in the Application \r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\nRedux manages the global state of the application, ensuring synchronization between Firebase and the user interface. Upon initialization, all posts are fetched from Firebase and stored in posts, an array that holds all existing posts.\r\n\r\nThe Redux state structure also includes oldPosts for older posts and newpost for newly created ones. When a user adds a new post, it's first stored in newpost, then added to both posts and jokes to keep the UI up-to-date. This allows real-time updates and ensures smooth content management across the application.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n name: 'post',\r\n  initialState: {\r\n    posts: [],\r\n    newPost: [],\r\n    topTen: [],\r\n    oldPost: [],\r\n    wellcomeState: 'empty',\r\n    writtenPost: false,\r\n    existUser: false,\r\n    cookieConsent: false,\r\n    deleteAccount: false,\r\n    error: {\r\n      errorMainArr: false,\r\n      errorMajorArr: false,\r\n      formError: false,\r\n      registration: false,\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Custom Hook for Post Updates (Like/Dislike)\r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\nIn this application, posts are categorized into two types: those containing obscene words and those that are normal. The like/dislike functionality relies on three key parameters: id, type, and url. The id uniquely identifies a post, type specifies whether it's a like or a dislike, and url determines which division the post belongs to (either containing obscene content or not). This url corresponds to different sections in the database, as the posts are stored separately to simplify analysis of the content.\r\n\r\nTo implement this functionality, a custom hook is designed to handle post updates based on user interaction. The process can be broken down as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Item 1 URL Fetching from env: Based on the provided url (indicating the division), the custom hook retrieves the corresponding URL stored in the environment file (.env). This URL points to the specific division of posts, allowing for clear separation of content that contains obscene words from normal content.\r\n\r\n2. Item 2 Like/Dislike Action: Once the hook receives the type (either \"like\" or \"dislike\"), it triggers an API call to the appropriate division (using the URL retrieved from env). The post’s unique id is used to fetch the relevant post data for processing.\r\n\r\n3. Item 3 Post Comparison and State Update: After fetching the post, the custom hook compares it to the corresponding entry in the oldPosts array (which holds previously fetched post data). If the post has changed—such as when the like/dislike count has been updated—the hook will update the Redux state with the new data. If the post differs from its previous state, it will be added to the posts array in Redux for UI reactivity.\r\n\r\n4. Item 4 Database Synchronization: Once the UI state is updated with the new like/dislike data, the hook ensures the changes are reflected in the Firebase database by sending an update request, ensuring consistency between the frontend and the backend.\r\n\r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { postActions } from '../store/post-slice';\r\nimport { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';\r\nconst useUpdate = () => {\r\n  const dispatch = useDispatch();\r\n\r\n  const mapPutVote = async (id, type, url) => {\r\n    const sendId = id;\r\n    const URL = url;\r\n\r\n    let response;\r\n    let comeFrom;\r\n    if (URL === process.env.REACT_APP_URL_POST) {\r\n      comeFrom = 'AllPosts';\r\n      response = await fetch(\r\n        process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixNormalDB + sendId + '.json'\r\n      );\r\n    } else {\r\n      comeFrom = 'MajorPosts';\r\n      response = await fetch(\r\n        process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixMajorDB + sendId + '.json'\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n    const data = await response.json();\r\n    let notIncremented = data.vote;\r\n    \r\n    let isIncrmented;\r\n\r\n    if (type === 'increment') {\r\n      isIncrmented = ++notIncremented;\r\n    } else if (type === 'decrease' && notIncremented <= 0) {\r\n      isIncrmented = notIncremented;\r\n    } else {\r\n      isIncrmented = --notIncremented;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const sendVote = { vote: isIncrmented };\r\n    const newVote = sendVote.vote;\r\n    const sendPayload = {\r\n      comeFrom: comeFrom,\r\n      id: sendId,\r\n      vote: sendVote.vote,\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    let switchedUrl;\r\n\r\n    if (URL === process.env.REACT_APP_URL_BANC) {\r\n      switchedUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixNormalDB + sendId + '.json';\r\n    } else if (URL === process.env.REACT_APP_URL_MAJOR) {\r\n      switchedUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixMajorDB + sendId + '.json';\r\n    }\r\n    if (notIncremented > 0) {\r\n      setTimeout(() => {\r\n        fetch(switchedUrl, {\r\n          method: 'PATCH',\r\n          body: JSON.stringify({ vote: newVote }),\r\n        });\r\n      }, 700);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    dispatch(postActions.upDateOldPosts(sendPayload));\r\n\r\n  };\r\n  return { mapPutVote };\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default useUpdate;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## More\r\n\r\n<div className=\"image columns-1 sm:columns-2 gap-8\">\r\n\r\n![React 03.](/images/project/01-02.jpg)\r\n![React 03.](/images/project/01-03.jpg)\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
