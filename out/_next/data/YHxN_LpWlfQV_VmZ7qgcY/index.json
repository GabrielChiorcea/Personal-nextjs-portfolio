React: The main library used for building the user interface.\n2. Redux: State management to ensure a smooth and consistent user experience.\n3. Firebase: Used for authentication and real-time data storage.\n4. React Router: Manages routing and navigation within the application.\n5. Styled Components: Styles React components to create a modern and attractive interface.\n6. Material-UI: A UI component library to accelerate development and ensure design consistency.\n\n## Project Structure\nComponents: Contains all reusable components of the application, such as buttons, forms, and lists.\nPages: Contains the main pages of the application, such as the menu page, cart page, and admin page.\nStore: Contains the Redux configuration and reducers for managing the application's state.\nFirebase: Configuration for Firebase authentication and data storage.\n\n## Redux :\n\n\n```javascript\n\nimport { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';\n\nconst initialCartState = {\n  items: [],\n  meals: [],\n  totalAmount: 0,\n  isAdmin: false,\n  stockButton: false,\n  productButton: false,\n  orderButton: true\n\n};\n\nconst orderSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'order',\n  initialState: initialCartState,\n  reducers: {\n    addItem(state, action) {\n      const newItem = action.payload;\n      const existingItem = state.items.find(item => item.id === newItem.id);\n      state.totalAmount += newItem.price * newItem.amount;\n      if (!existingItem) {\n        state.items.push({\n          id: newItem.id,\n          name: newItem.name,\n          amount: newItem.amount,\n          price: newItem.price,\n        });\n      } else {\n        existingItem.amount += newItem.amount;\n      }\n    },\n    removeItem(state, action) {\n      const id = action.payload;\n      const existingItem = state.items.find(item => item.id === id);\n      state.totalAmount -= existingItem.price;\n      if (existingItem.amount === 1) {\n        state.items = state.items.filter(item => item.id !== id);\n      } else {\n        existingItem.amount--;\n      }\n    },\n    addMeal(state, action) {\n      const newMeal = action.payload;\n      const existingMeal = state.meals.find(meal => meal.id === newMeal.id);\n      if (!existingMeal) {\n        state.meals.push({\n          id: newMeal.id,\n          name: newMeal.name,\n          description: newMeal.description,\n          price: newMeal.price,\n          availability: newMeal.availability,\n        });\n      }\n    },\n    clearCart(state) {\n      state.items = [];\n      state.totalAmount = 0;\n    },\n    loginAdmin(state, action) {\n      state.isAdmin = action.payload;\n    },\n\n    setStockButton(state, action) {\n      state.stockButton = action.payload;\n    },\n\n    setProductButton(state, action) {\n      state.productButton = action.payload;\n    },\n\n    setOrderButton(state, action) {\n      state.orderButton = action.payload;\n    }\n  },\n});\n\nexport const orderActions = orderSlice.actions;\nexport default orderSlice.reducer;\n\n```\n\n1. The order-slice.js file defines the initial state and the reducers for managing the cart state.\n2. The createSlice function from Redux Toolkit is used to create a slice of the state, which includes actions and reducers.\n3. The initial state includes properties like items, meals, totalAmount, isAdmin, stockButton, productButton, and orderButton.\n4. The reducers define how the state should be updated in response to actions. For example, the addItem reducer adds a new item to the cart, and the removeItem reducer removes an item from the cart.\n\n## Configuring the Redux Store:\n\nThe index.js file in the store directory configures the Redux store using the configureStore function from Redux Toolkit. The store is configured with the orderReducer created in the order-slice.js file.\n\nProviding the Redux Store to the Application:\nThe index.js file in the root directory wraps the App component with the Provider component from react-redux and passes the store to it.\nThis makes the Redux store available to all components in the application.\n\nBy using Redux for state management, the React Meals application ensures a predictable and efficient way to manage the application state. Redux helps in maintaining a single source of truth for the state, making it easier to debug and test the application. The use of Redux Toolkit simplifies the setup and reduces boilerplate code, allowing for a more streamlined development process.\n\n\n\n\n"},{"slug":"checker","frontMatter":{"date":"2023-11-11","title":"User Manager","lang":"Build with C#","description":"This project is an interactive web application developed with Blazor WebAssembly, utilizing Fluxor for state management and including custom services for authentication and handling HTTP requests.","image":"/images/project/03.jpg","color":"#BF4106","category":"Frontend","projectInfo":[{"title":"Client","data":"World wide"},{"title":"Timeline","data":"Ready for tests"},{"title":"Tehnology","data":"- C#, Blazor\n- Fluxor \n- Bootstrap  \n"},{"title":"Functions","data":"- User Profile\n- User Account\n- Delete, Update, Create user acount\n"}],"live":[{"link":"https://user-manager.gabrielchiorcea.eu/"}]},"content":"\r\n\r\n<div className=\"image columns-1 sm:columns-2 gap-8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n![C# 02.](/images/project/03-02.jpg)\r\n![C# 01.](/images/project/03-01.jpg)\r\n![C# 03.](/images/project/03-03.jpg)\r\n![C# 03.](/images/project/03-04.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Project Overview\r\n\r\nChecker is a web application designed to manage user profiles and account settings.

This state could include information such as the user's profile details, loading status, and any errors.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nProfileCardState Definition:\r\n\r\nThe ProfileCardState class is defined in the State.cs file. It includes properties like HomeAddress, Country, County, Occupation, FullName, Email, Image, and various social media links.\r\n```C#\r\npublic class ProfileCardState\r\n{\r\n    public string HomeAddress { get; set; }\r\n    public string Country { get; set; }\r\n    public string County { get; set; }\r\n    public string Occupation { get; set; }\r\n    public string FullName { get; set; }\r\n    public string Email { get; set; }\r\n    public byte[] Image { get; set; }\r\n    public string LinkedIn { get; set; }\r\n    public string FaceBook { get; set; }\r\n    public string GitHub { get; set; }\r\n    public string Instagram { get; set; }\r\n    public string Twitter { get; set; }\r\n    public string Youtube { get; set; }\r\n    public string Description { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public ProfileCardState(string homeAddress, string country, string county, string occupation, string fullname, string email, byte[] image, string linkedIn, string faceBook, string gitHub, string instagram, string twitter, string youtube, string description)\r\n    {\r\n        HomeAddress = homeAddress;\r\n        Country = country;\r\n        County = county;\r\n        Occupation = occupation;\r\n        Image = image;\r\n        FullName = fullname;\r\n        Email = email;\r\n        LinkedIn = linkedIn;\r\n        FaceBook = faceBook;\r\n        GitHub = gitHub;\r\n        Instagram = instagram;\r\n        Twitter = twitter;\r\n        Youtube = youtube;\r\n        Description = description;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public ProfileCardState() { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has constructors to initialize these properties, including a parameterless constructor for flexibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeature Initialization:\r\n\r\nThe ProfileCardFeature class, defined in the Feature.cs file, specifies the initial state of ProfileCardState with default values.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nusing Fluxor;\r\n\r\nnamespace Checker.state\r\n{\r\n    public class ProfileCardFeature : Feature<ProfileCardState>\r\n    {\r\n        public override string GetName() => \"ProfileCard\";\r\n\r\n        protected override ProfileCardState GetInitialState() =>\r\n            new ProfileCardState(\r\n                string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, new byte[0], \r\n                string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, \r\n                string.Empty\r\n            );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nReducers:\r\n\r\nThe ProfileCardReducer class, found in the Reducers.cs file, handles state changes. The ReduceProfileCard method updates the state based on the GetProfileCardState action by creating a new ProfileCardState with updated values.\r\n```C#\r\nusing Fluxor;\r\n\r\nnamespace Checker.state\r\n{\r\n    public static class ProfileCardReducer\r\n    {\r\n        [ReducerMethod]\r\n        public static ProfileCardState ReduceProfileCard(ProfileCardState state, GetProfileCardState action)\r\n        {\r\n            return new ProfileCardState(\r\n                action.State.HomeAddress,\r\n                action.State.Country,\r\n                action.State.County,\r\n                action.State.Occupation,\r\n                action.State.FullName,\r\n                action.State.Email,            \r\n                action.State.Image,\r\n                action.State.LinkedIn,\r\n                action.State.FaceBook,\r\n                action.State.GitHub,\r\n                action.State.Instagram,\r\n                action.State.Twitter,\r\n                action.State.Youtube,\r\n                action.State.Description\r\n            );\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage in Components:\r\n\r\nIn various Razor components like ProfileRender.razor, HomeRender.razor, and AdminRender.razor, the ProfileCardState is injected and used to display profile information.\r\nThese components fetch user data from the server and dispatch actions to update the state. For example, when the profile page is loaded, it checks the authentication token and fetches the user's profile data to update the state.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n@page \"/profile\"\r\n\r\n@using Checker.Pages.Message\r\n@using global::Checker.state\r\n@using global::Checker.Models \r\n@using global::Checker.Services\r\n@using global::Checker.features\r\n@using Fluxor\r\n@inject AuthenticationTocken authenticationtocken\r\n@inject IState<ProfileCardState> ProfileCardState\r\n\r\n@inject FetchService fetchService\r\n@inject IDispatcher Dispatcher\r\n\r\n@if(error == false){\r\n    @if(isLoading){\r\n        <BlazorChecking/>\r\n    } else if(tokenState){\r\n        <ProfileDom/>\r\n    }else{\r\n        <Restricted/>\r\n    }\r\n}else{\r\n    <BlazorError/>\r\n}\r\n\r\n@code{\r\n    bool isLoading = true;\r\n    bool error = false;\r\n    bool tokenState;\r\n    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()\r\n    {\r\n        tokenState = await authenticationtocken.Check();\r\n        \r\n        if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(ProfileCardState.Value.FullName)){\r\n            isLoading = false;\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        string tokenString = await authenticationtocken.GetTocken();\r\n        if(tokenState){\r\n            try{\r\n                var response = await fetchService.GetResponsSocialCard($\"{AppSettings.ApiBaseUrl}/get\", tokenString);\r\n                Dispatcher.Dispatch(new GetProfileCardState(response));\r\n                if(response != null){\r\n                    isLoading = false;\r\n                }else{\r\n                    throw new Exception(\"eroare\");\r\n                }\r\n            } catch (Exception) {\r\n                error = true;\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n        }else{\r\n            isLoading = false;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis setup ensures consistent management and updating of the profile information across the application using Fluxor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"slug":"quote","frontMatter":{"date":"2017-10-10","title":"Social App","lang":"Build with React","description":"This project is a standalone frontend application built with React, focusing on delivering a streamlined user experience.

It does not have a dedicated backend; instead, it relies on Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) for data storage and real-time functionality. Designed with a mobile-first approach, the application prioritizes optimization for mobile devices, providing core features inspired by Facebook, such as sharing posts and liking them.\r\n\r\n<div className=\"image columns-1 sm:columns-2 gap-8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n![React 02.](/images/project/01.jpg)\r\n![React 04.](/images/project/01-01.jpg)\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nFor data storage, the application uses a NoSQL Firebase database. User data, such as account creation information, is temporarily stored in the local session (e.g., localStorage or sessionStorage) and then sent to Firebase for permanent storage. Posts and other content-related data are retrieved from Firebase through API calls, often referred to as \"gates.\" These are then integrated into the app's state, which is managed using Redux, ensuring a consistent and efficient flow of information between components.\r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\nThe application incorporates modern technologies to achieve its functionality. While React serves as the framework for building the user interface, Sass is used for styling, offering modular and reusable designs. Redux is at the core of the app’s state management, enabling smooth synchronization of data such as posts, likes, and shares. Middleware like Redux Thunk facilitates handling asynchronous API calls to Firebase, ensuring organized and efficient state updates.\r\n\r\nThe user interactions within the app are intuitive and align with familiar patterns from social media platforms. For instance, users can share posts or like them, with these actions updating both the local state and Firebase in real-time. Account creation is straightforward, with user details initially stored locally before being validated and saved in Firebase. Posts and related interactions, once fetched, are synchronized with the Redux Store, making them readily accessible across various parts of the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redux Role in the Application \r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\nRedux manages the global state of the application, ensuring synchronization between Firebase and the user interface. Upon initialization, all posts are fetched from Firebase and stored in posts, an array that holds all existing posts.\r\n\r\nThe Redux state structure also includes oldPosts for older posts and newpost for newly created ones. When a user adds a new post, it's first stored in newpost, then added to both posts and jokes to keep the UI up-to-date. This allows real-time updates and ensures smooth content management across the application.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n name: 'post',\r\n  initialState: {\r\n    posts: [],\r\n    newPost: [],\r\n    topTen: [],\r\n    oldPost: [],\r\n    wellcomeState: 'empty',\r\n    writtenPost: false,\r\n    existUser: false,\r\n    cookieConsent: false,\r\n    deleteAccount: false,\r\n    error: {\r\n      errorMainArr: false,\r\n      errorMajorArr: false,\r\n      formError: false,\r\n      registration: false,\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Custom Hook for Post Updates (Like/Dislike)\r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\nIn this application, posts are categorized into two types: those containing obscene words and those that are normal. The like/dislike functionality relies on three key parameters: id, type, and url. The id uniquely identifies a post, type specifies whether it's a like or a dislike, and url determines which division the post belongs to (either containing obscene content or not). This url corresponds to different sections in the database, as the posts are stored separately to simplify analysis of the content.\r\n\r\nTo implement this functionality, a custom hook is designed to handle post updates based on user interaction. The process can be broken down as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Item 1 URL Fetching from env: Based on the provided url (indicating the division), the custom hook retrieves the corresponding URL stored in the environment file (.env). This URL points to the specific division of posts, allowing for clear separation of content that contains obscene words from normal content.\r\n\r\n2. Item 2 Like/Dislike Action: Once the hook receives the type (either \"like\" or \"dislike\"), it triggers an API call to the appropriate division (using the URL retrieved from env). The post’s unique id is used to fetch the relevant post data for processing.\r\n\r\n3. Item 3 Post Comparison and State Update: After fetching the post, the custom hook compares it to the corresponding entry in the oldPosts array (which holds previously fetched post data). If the post has changed—such as when the like/dislike count has been updated—the hook will update the Redux state with the new data. If the post differs from its previous state, it will be added to the posts array in Redux for UI reactivity.\r\n\r\n4. Item 4 Database Synchronization: Once the UI state is updated with the new like/dislike data, the hook ensures the changes are reflected in the Firebase database by sending an update request, ensuring consistency between the frontend and the backend.\r\n\r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { postActions } from '../store/post-slice';\r\nimport { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';\r\nconst useUpdate = () => {\r\n  const dispatch = useDispatch();\r\n\r\n  const mapPutVote = async (id, type, url) => {\r\n    const sendId = id;\r\n    const URL = url;\r\n\r\n    let response;\r\n    let comeFrom;\r\n    if (URL === process.env.REACT_APP_URL_POST) {\r\n      comeFrom = 'AllPosts';\r\n      response = await fetch(\r\n        process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixNormalDB + sendId + '.json'\r\n      );\r\n    } else {\r\n      comeFrom = 'MajorPosts';\r\n      response = await fetch(\r\n        process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixMajorDB + sendId + '.json'\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n    const data = await response.json();\r\n    let notIncremented = data.vote;\r\n    \r\n    let isIncrmented;\r\n\r\n    if (type === 'increment') {\r\n      isIncrmented = ++notIncremented;\r\n    } else if (type === 'decrease' && notIncremented <= 0) {\r\n      isIncrmented = notIncremented;\r\n    } else {\r\n      isIncrmented = --notIncremented;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const sendVote = { vote: isIncrmented };\r\n    const newVote = sendVote.vote;\r\n    const sendPayload = {\r\n      comeFrom: comeFrom,\r\n      id: sendId,\r\n      vote: sendVote.vote,\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    let switchedUrl;\r\n\r\n    if (URL === process.env.REACT_APP_URL_BANC) {\r\n      switchedUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixNormalDB + sendId + '.json';\r\n    } else if (URL === process.env.REACT_APP_URL_MAJOR) {\r\n      switchedUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixMajorDB + sendId + '.json';\r\n    }\r\n    if (notIncremented > 0) {\r\n      setTimeout(() => {\r\n        fetch(switchedUrl, {\r\n          method: 'PATCH',\r\n          body: JSON.stringify({ vote: newVote }),\r\n        });\r\n      }, 700);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    dispatch(postActions.upDateOldPosts(sendPayload));\r\n\r\n  };\r\n  return { mapPutVote };\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default useUpdate;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## More\r\n\r\n<div className=\"image columns-1 sm:columns-2 gap-8\">\r\n\r\n![React 03.](/images/project/01-02.jpg)\r\n![React 03.](/images/project/01-03.jpg)\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"slug":"power","frontMatter":{"date":"2016-10-10","title":"Excel Model Viewer","lang":"Build with React","description":"This frontend serves two primary and critical functions: processing an Excel file and handling JSON-formatted data received from the backend.

It uses useState for managing file input, validation, and upload readiness, while useDispatch triggers Redux actions. The component validates files against .xlsx or .xls extensions and, upon validation, sends the file to the backend via a POST request at /excel, using FormData. It dynamically renders two views: a file input with a \"Validate\" button for initial upload and a \"Start\" button for submission. Modular CSS ensures styling, creating a user-friendly interface for seamless file upload and backend integration.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst ExcelAdIn = () => {\r\n  const dispatch = useDispatch();\r\n\r\n  const [validate, setValidate] = useState(false);\r\n  const [isExcel, setIsExcel] = useState(false);\r\n  const [excelFile, setExcelFile] = useState(undefined);\r\n\r\n  const onSubmit = () => {\r\n    if (excelFile !== undefined) {\r\n      setIsExcel(true);\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const excelReader = () => {\r\n    const allowedExtensions = ['.xlsx', '.xls'];\r\n\r\n    if (excelFile && allowedExtensions.includes(excelFile.name.slice(-5))) {\r\n      dispatch(excelAction.excelUpLoad(true));\r\n      const formData = new FormData();\r\n      formData.append('file', excelFile);\r\n      fetch('#########', {\r\n        method: 'POST',\r\n        headers: {\r\n          'Content-Type': 'application/json',\r\n        },\r\n        body: formData,\r\n      }).then((response) => console.log(response.json()));\r\n      console.log(formData);\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const start = (\r\n    <div className={style.container}>\r\n      <button className={style.start} onClick={excelReader}>\r\n        Start\r\n      </button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  const addExcel = (\r\n    <div className={style.container}>\r\n      {!validate && (\r\n        <div className={style.addExcel}>\r\n          <label htmlFor=\"file-input\" className={style.fileLabel}>\r\n            Add Excel\r\n          </label>\r\n          <input\r\n            type=\"file\"\r\n            accept=\".xlsx, .xls\"\r\n            className={style.fileInput}\r\n            onChange={(e) => {\r\n              setExcelFile(e.target.files[0]);\r\n              setValidate(true);\r\n            }}\r\n          />\r\n        </div>\r\n      )}\r\n      {validate && (\r\n        <button className={style.start} onClick={onSubmit}>\r\n          Validate\r\n        </button>\r\n      )}\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  return <Fragment>{isExcel ? start : addExcel}</Fragment>;\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default ExcelAdIn;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Custom Hook for Dynamic API Requests and Data Handling\r\n\r\nThe useQAfetch custom hook is designed to handle API interactions with a backend for various data retrieval or manipulation tasks related to Excel processing. It uses Redux's dispatch to update the application state based on the API responses. Here's a technical explanation:\r\n\r\n1. Hook Structure: The hook defines an asynchronous function, fetchServer, which accepts a string parameter that determines the API endpoint or function to call.\r\n\r\n2. Dynamic Endpoint Selection: Based on the provided string, the function appends it to a base URL to construct the endpoint dynamically. Specific cases, such as \"Count null value,\" \"Excel summary,\" and others, are handled with conditional logic.\r\n\r\n3. API Call: It uses the fetch API to make HTTP GET requests to the backend. If the string corresponds to an \"Under construction\" case, it directly dispatches a placeholder response without making a request.\r\n\r\n4. Response Parsing:\r\nThe response status is validated, and errors are caught and handled gracefully.\r\nFor valid responses, the JSON payload is parsed and structured into a standardized format, with fields like rows, columns, and max_value populated for specific strings.\r\n\r\n5. Data Dispatch: The parsed data is dispatched to the Redux store using an excelAction.excelResponse action. For \"fill NAN W 0,\" the response is further processed into an array before dispatching.\r\n\r\n6. Error Handling: If the request fails, the error message and response code are logged, and a standardized error response is dispatched to maintain consistency in the application's state.\r\n\r\n7. Flexibility: By accepting a string parameter, the hook can reuse the same logic for different backend functionalities, reducing code duplication and enhancing maintainability.\r\n\r\nThis custom hook encapsulates API interaction logic, making it modular and easier to integrate into various components that need backend communication.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst useQAfetch = () => {\r\n  const dispatch = useDispatch();\r\n\r\n  const fetchServer = async (string) => {\r\n    const url = '#########';\r\n    let str = string;\r\n    let responseCode;\r\n    let dataRespons;\r\n    let fillNan = [];\r\n    try {\r\n      let response;\r\n      if (str === 'Count null value') {\r\n        response = await fetch(url + str);\r\n      } else if (str === 'Excel summary') {\r\n        response = await fetch(url + str);\r\n      } else if (str === 'Extract value') {\r\n        response = await fetch(url + str);\r\n      } else if (str === 'Chart') {\r\n        response = await fetch(url + str);\r\n      } else if (str === 'Under costruction') {\r\n        dataRespons = {\r\n          res: 'Under costruction',\r\n          question: str,\r\n        };\r\n        console.log(dataRespons);\r\n        dispatch(excelAction.excelResponse(dataRespons));\r\n        return;\r\n      } else if (str === 'fill NAN W 0') {\r\n        response = await fetch(url + str);\r\n      } else {\r\n        response = await fetch(url + str);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      responseCode = response.status;\r\n\r\n      if (!response.ok) {\r\n        throw new Error('Network response was not ok');\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      const data = await response.json();\r\n\r\n      if (str === 'Count null value') {\r\n        dataRespons = { res: data.value, question: str };\r\n      } else if (str === 'Excel summary') {\r\n        dataRespons = {\r\n          rows: data.rows,\r\n          columns: data.columns,\r\n          col_dtypes: data.col_dtypes,\r\n          max_value: data.max_value,\r\n          min_value: data.min_value,\r\n          question: str,\r\n        };\r\n      } else if (str === 'Extract value') {\r\n        dataRespons = {\r\n          value: data.value,\r\n          columns: data.columns,\r\n          row: data.row,\r\n          question: str,\r\n        };\r\n      } else if ('fill NAN W 0') {\r\n        dataRespons = data;\r\n        for (const key in dataRespons) {\r\n          fillNan.push({\r\n            id: dataRespons[key].column,\r\n            question: str,\r\n            column: dataRespons[key].column,\r\n            value: dataRespons[key].arr,\r\n          });\r\n        }\r\n      } else if (str === 'Chart') {\r\n        dataRespons = { res: data.value, question: str };\r\n      } else {\r\n        dataRespons = {\r\n          res: data.value,\r\n          question: str,\r\n        };\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      if (str === 'fill NAN W 0') {\r\n        dispatch(excelAction.excelResponse(fillNan));\r\n      } else {\r\n        dispatch(excelAction.excelResponse(dataRespons));\r\n      }\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n      console.log(error, responseCode);\r\n      dataRespons = {\r\n        res: `We tryed to call the server but the server code is ${responseCode}`,\r\n        question: 'Error',\r\n      };\r\n      dispatch(excelAction.excelResponse(dataRespons));\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return { fetchServer };\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default useQAfetch;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Chart Configuration and Visualization\r\n\r\nThe ChartSettings component is responsible for configuring a chart based on the selected columns from an Excel file, interacting with a backend API. Using useSelector, it extracts data from the application state, including existing responses and current chart configurations. The user can select columns for the X and Y axes, as well as the colors associated with them. These settings are then sent to the backend via a POST request in JSON format. If the request is successful, an image file (the generated chart) is returned, processed, and displayed to the user. The component also includes options to reset the current configuration and displays error messages if the data is invalid or the server request fails. All of these operations are handled using React, with state management via useState and useDispatch, and the interface dynamically updates as the user interacts with the data selection components.\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst ChartSettings = () => {\r\n  const arr = useSelector((select) => select.exe.excelResponse);\r\n  const c = useSelector((state) => state.exe.chart);\r\n  const dispatch = useDispatch();\r\n  const [colXoane, setColXoane] = useState('');\r\n  const [colXtow, setColXtow] = useState('');\r\n  const [colY, setColY] = useState('');\r\n  const [full, setFull] = useState(false);\r\n  const [imageData, setImageData] = useState(null);\r\n  const [s, setS] = useState(false);\r\n  const [err, setErr] = useState(false);\r\n\r\n  const [selectedColorXoane, setSelectedColorXoane] = useState('Blue');\r\n  const [selectedColorXtow, setSelectedColorXtow] = useState('Blue');\r\n\r\n  const handleColorChangeXoane = (event) => {\r\n    setSelectedColorXoane(event.target.value);\r\n  };\r\n  const handleColorChangeXtow = (event) => {\r\n    setSelectedColorXtow(event.target.value);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const setCol = (name) => {\r\n    if (colXoane === '') {\r\n      setColXoane(name);\r\n    } else if (colXtow === '') {\r\n      setColXtow(name);\r\n      setFull(true);\r\n    } else if (colXoane !== '' && colXtow !== '') {\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const setY = (name) => {\r\n    setColY(name);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const json = {\r\n    columnX1: [colXoane, selectedColorXoane],\r\n    columnX2: [colXtow, selectedColorXtow],\r\n    Y: colY,\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const createChart = async () => {\r\n    try {\r\n      const response = await fetch('#########', {\r\n        method: 'POST',\r\n        headers: {\r\n          'Content-Type': 'application/json',\r\n        },\r\n        body: JSON.stringify(json),\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      if (!response.ok) {\r\n        throw new Error('Eroare la cerere');\r\n      }\r\n      const blob = await response.blob();\r\n      const imageUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\r\n      setImageData(imageUrl);\r\n      dispatch(excelAction.chart(true));\r\n      setS(true);\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n      console.error(`An error occurred: ${error.message}`);\r\n      setErr('This combination does not make sens');\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(json);\r\n  };\r\n  const restore = () => {\r\n    setColXoane('');\r\n    setColXtow('');\r\n    setColY('');\r\n    setFull(false);\r\n    setImageData(null);\r\n    setS(false);\r\n    setSelectedColorXoane('Blue');\r\n    setSelectedColorXtow('Blue');\r\n    dispatch(excelAction.chart(false));\r\n    setErr(false);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const relode = (\r\n    <button className={btn.btn} onClick={restore}>\r\n      relode\r\n    </button>\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  const colNames = arr.res.map((el) => (\r\n    <ChartBtn key={el} name={el} col={el} onClick={full ?

It allows users to dynamically select columns for chart creation, customize colors, and submit requests to the backend. The component handles responses efficiently, displaying the generated chart as an image. With a focus on flexibility, it supports multiple combinations of input data and ensures proper error handling to provide a smooth user experience. The inclusion of a reset functionality allows for easy restoration of settings. This front-end approach integrates effectively with the backend, ensuring the process from data selection to chart generation is seamless, intuitive, and user-friendly.\r\n"},{"slug":"store","frontMatter":{"date":"2015-10-10","title":"Excel Model Viewer Backend","lang":"Build with Python","description":"This application serves as a backend capable of processing and reading data from Excel files.

To utilize this backend and connect it to a frontend, a user account is required. The account is essential as it provides a unique API key for authentication and authorization.\r\n\r\nExcel files are read using Pandas, which converts the file content into a DataFrame. Once transformed into a DataFrame, the data is further converted into JSON format based on the specific functions or filters requested. This enables dynamic and customizable data extraction from the Excel file.\r\n\r\nThe Excel file itself is stored in the database as a binary large object (BLOB), ensuring secure and efficient storage\r\n\r\n\r\n<div className=\"image columns-1 sm:columns-2 gap-8\">\r\n\r\n![Python 01.](/images/project/05-01.jpg)\r\n![Python 02.](/images/project/05-02.jpg)\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Get and store the excel file\r\n\r\nThe Excel file is uploaded via the /excel endpoint of the API. At this endpoint, the file undergoes validation to ensure it is an Excel file, even if the frontend does not perform this check. Once validated, the file is renamed for consistency and security.\r\n\r\nThe renaming process involves appending a unique ID, derived from the user’s API key, to the file name. The resulting format is {ID}.xlsx. The renamed file is then securely stored in the database as a BLOB with its new identifier, ensuring traceability and efficient management.\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@app.route('/excel', methods=['POST'])\r\n@csrf.exempt\r\ndef upload_excel():\r\n    try:\r\n        # Check if a file is present in the request\r\n        if 'file' not in request.files:\r\n            return jsonify({'res': 'No file found in the request'}), 400\r\n        \r\n        file_in = request.files['file']\r\n        id = request.args.get('id')\r\n\r\n        # Validate the user ID parameter\r\n        if not id:\r\n            return jsonify({'res': 'Missing user ID'}), 400\r\n\r\n        # Check if the file name is empty\r\n        if file_in.filename == '':\r\n            return jsonify({'res': 'File name is empty'}), 400\r\n\r\n        # Validate the file extension (only .xlsx and .xls are allowed)\r\n        if not (file_in.filename.endswith('.xlsx') or file_in.filename.endswith('.xls')):\r\n            return jsonify({'res': 'Invalid file type, only Excel files are allowed (.xlsx, .xls)'}), 400\r\n\r\n        file_content = file_in.read()\r\n        \r\n        # Ensure the file is not empty\r\n        if not file_content:\r\n            return jsonify({'res': 'Uploaded file is empty'}), 400\r\n\r\n        # Generate a unique name for the file based on the user ID\r\n        file_name = f\"{id}.xlsx\"\r\n\r\n        # Create a new database record for the Excel file\r\n        new_excel_file = Excel(name=file_name, excel=file_content)\r\n\r\n        # Add the file to the database session and commit\r\n        db.session.add(new_excel_file)\r\n        db.session.commit()\r\n\r\n        return jsonify({'res': 'File uploaded successfully'}), 200\r\n\r\n    except Exception as e:\r\n        # Roll back the database transaction in case of an error\r\n        db.session.rollback()\r\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")  # Log the error details to the console\r\n        return jsonify({'res': f'An error occurred while processing the file: {str(e)}'}), 500\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How the backend know what data to give you\r\n\r\nThe below API endpoint, accessible via /<string:para>/<string:ident> with a GET request, dynamically processes Excel files stored in a database. It retrieves the file based on an id query parameter, reads it into a Pandas DataFrame, and executes specific functions depending on the para value (e.g., counting null values, extracting data, summarizing content, filling missing values, or generating charts). The user's existence and identification (ident) are validated against the database, and if necessary, new identification records are created.

It is designed to handle user sign-up, login, profile updates, and account management. The backend interacts with a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).\r\nThis backend leverages a combination of Flask, SQLAlchemy, PyJWT, MySQL, and Werkzeug to provide a robust and secure user authentication and profile management system. Flask serves as the web framework, SQLAlchemy handles database interactions, PyJWT manages token-based authentication, MySQL stores user data, and Werkzeug provides essential utilities for web application development. This technology stack ensures efficient and secure handling of user data and authentication processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PyJWT Usage in This Backend\r\n\r\n#### How PyJWT is Used in This Backend:\r\n\r\n1. Token Generation:\r\nWhen a user logs in, a JWT is generated using the create_access_token function. This token includes the user's ID and an expiration time. The token is then sent in the database, to the client we give a code related to the token, which stores it and includes it in the Authorization header of subsequent requests.\r\n\r\n| id \t| session_string \t| jwt                                                   \t|\r\n|----\t|----------------\t|-------------------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| 44 \t| 8PBV22S        \t| eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVzaCI6Z... \t|\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, nothing relate to the id of the user, the id is inside of jwt and need special decode for extract the ID.\r\n\r\n2. Token Verification:\r\nFor protected routes, the backend verifies the JWT included in the Authorization header of incoming requests. The token is decoded using the jwt.decode function, which extracts the user's ID and other claims. If the token is valid, the request is processed; otherwise, an error response is returned.\r\n\r\n3. Session Management:\r\nThe backend uses JWTs to manage user sessions. When a user logs in, a session is created with the generated token. This session is used to authenticate the user for subsequent requests.\r\n\r\n## Key Features: \r\n### User Authentication:\r\n\r\nSign-Up: Allows users to create an account by providing an email and password.

We'll walk you through everything from installing the necessary packages to configuring your environment to run Django in production. Let's get started!","image":"/images/blog/django.jpg","date":"2025-01-04","category":"Server"},"content":"\n\n## Preparing the Server\n\nFirst things first: we need to update your server and install the essential packages.\n\n -  Run these commands to update and install everything you need:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\nsudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev libpq-dev nginx -y\n```\n\nHere’s what each package is for:\n\n- `python3-pip`: The tool that lets you install Python packages you’ll need for your app.\n    \n- `python3-venv`: Allows you to create a virtual environment for Python—this keeps things nice and clean.\n    \n- `python3-dev`: Development headers and libraries for building Python packages.\n    \n- `libpq-dev`: Required for connecting your Django app to PostgreSQL if you're using that as your database.\n    \n-  `nginx`: This is the web server we’re going to use to serve your Django app.\n\n----------\n\n### Creating the App Directory\n\nNow let’s create the directory where your Django app will live and set the right permissions.\n\n1.  Make the directory:\n\n```bash\nsudo mkdir -p /var/www/domain.com/app\n```\n2.  Set the correct permissions:\n\n```bash\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/domain.com/app\nsudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/domain.com\n``` \nWhat’s happening here:\n-   `mkdir -p`: Makes sure all the necessary folders are created (even the ones in the path).\n  \n-   `chown`: Changes the ownership of the directory to the current user (you).\n  \n-  `chmod`: Ensures the right read/execute permissions for the directory.\n\n----------\n\n### Configuring Nginx for Your App\n\nNow it’s time to set up Nginx to serve your Django app. Let’s create a configuration file for your domain.\n\n1.  Create the config file:\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/domain.com\n```\n\n2.  Add the following content to the file:\n\n\n```bash\n`server {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name domain.com www.domain.com;\n\n    root /var/www/domain.com/html;\n    index index.html;\n\n    location / {\n        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;\n    }\n}` \n```\nWhat’s happening here:\n -   `listen 80`: Tells Nginx to listen for HTTP traffic on port 80 (the standard for web traffic).\n    \n -   `server_name`: This specifies which domains Nginx should handle with this config.\n   \n -  `try_files`: It checks if the requested files exist. If not, it returns a 404 error.\n\n----------\n\n### Setting Up SSL with Let's Encrypt\n\nFor added security, you should use HTTPS. If you don’t already have an SSL certificate, Let’s Encrypt is a free, trusted option.\n\n1.  First, let’s redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS:\n\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name domain.com www.domain.com;\n    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n}\n```\n\n2.  Next, let’s set up the HTTPS server configuration:\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl;\n    server_name domain.com www.domain.com;\n\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/fullchain.pem;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/privkey.pem;\n    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;\n    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n    }\n\n    location /static/ {\n        alias /var/www/domain.com/app/static/;\n    }\n}\n``` \n\n Here’s what’s going on:\n-   `proxy_pass`: This tells Nginx to forward incoming requests to Gunicorn (which will run your Django app on port 8000).\n    \n-   `alias`: This directs Nginx to the static files folder where your Django app will store its static assets.\n\n----------\n\n### Activating the Nginx Configuration and Restarting the Service\n\nNow that we’ve got Nginx set up, let’s activate the configuration and restart Nginx.\n\n1.  Enable the site by creating a symbolic link:\n\n```bash\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/domain.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` \n```\n\n2.  Check for configuration errors:\n```bash\nsudo nginx -t\n```\n\n3.  If everything checks out, restart Nginx:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart nginx\n```\n\n----------\n\n## Setting Up the Django Project\n\nNext, let’s get your Django project set up and ready to go!\n\n1.  Create a virtual environment for Python:\n\n```bash\ncd /var/www/domain.com/app\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate \n```\n\n2.  Install Django and Gunicorn:\n\n```bash\npip install django gunicorn \n```\n\n----------\n\n### Creating the Django Project\n\n1.  Now, let’s create a new Django project:\n\n```bash\ndjango-admin startproject myproject .\n```\n\n2.  To test that everything’s running, start the Django development server:\n\n```bash\npython3 manage.py runserver\n```\n\n----------\n\n### Configuring Static Files\n\n1.  Create the static files directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /var/www/domain.com/app/static\n```\n\n2.  Update `settings.py` to point to the correct location for static files:\n\n\n```bash\nSTATIC_ROOT = \"/var/www/domain.com/app/static/\"\nSTATIC_URL = \"/static/\"\n```\n\n3.  Collect all the static files:\n```bash\npython manage.py collectstatic\n```\n-----------\n#### In Django, handling static files—like CSS, JavaScript, and images—requires special attention because of how static content is served in production versus development. Let’s break it down:\n\nWhy Static Files Need Configuration ?\n\nBy default, Django is optimized for development, and during development, it automatically serves static files using its built-in development server. However, this approach isn't suitable for production due to performance and security concerns. Instead:\n\nIn Development:\n\n   - Django's development server (e.g., when you run python manage.py runserver) handles static files directly, pulling them from the STATICFILES_DIRS or app-specific static folders (<app_name>/static).\nYou don't need to create or configure STATIC_ROOT or manually run collectstatic.\n\nIn Production:\n\n   - A web server like Nginx or Apache should serve static files. This ensures better performance since serving static assets isn’t what Django’s application server (like Gunicorn) is designed for.\nDjango needs all static files from various apps to be gathered into a single directory, specified by STATIC_ROOT. This is why the collectstatic command is necessary.\nWithout a properly set STATIC_ROOT, you can't collect and serve static files efficiently in production.\n\nWhy Create the Directory Manually?\n\n   - The directory defined by STATIC_ROOT (e.g., /var/www/domain.com/app/static/) is where Django collects all static files when you run:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py collectstatic\n```\n\nYou need to create this directory manually because:\n\n1. It's not automatically created by Django: Django only expects the STATIC_ROOT setting to point to an existing location.\n  \n2. Flexibility in deployment: You might want the static directory to be in a specific location, independent of Django’s project structure. For example, /var/www/... is commonly used in production setups.\n   \nDo You Need This in Both Production and Development?\n   - In Production: Yes, always. The STATIC_ROOT directory and the collectstatic process are essential in production environments because Django doesn’t serve static files directly. Instead, the web server (e.g., Nginx) will use the collected files.\n   - In Development: Not typically. Django's development server handles static files automatically using the STATICFILES_DIRS and app-specific static folders. You don't need to configure STATIC_ROOT or run collectstatic.\n\nIf you're testing a production-like environment locally, you might set it up in development to mirror production, but it’s optional.\n\n#### Key Takeaway\n\nThe manual creation of the STATIC_ROOT directory and running collectstatic are production-specific requirements. In development, Django simplifies the process, but in production, separating the app logic from static file serving is critical for performance and scalability.\n\n-----------\n4.  Set the right permissions on the static files folder:\n\n```bash\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/domain.com/app/static\nsudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/domain.com/app/static\n```\n\n\n\n### Setting Up the Gunicorn Service\n\nGunicorn will serve your Django app, so let’s set it up with a systemd service.\n\n1.  Create the Gunicorn service file:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service\n```\n\n2.  Add the following configuration:\n\n```bash\n[Unit]\nDescription=gunicorn daemon for Django project\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=www-data\nGroup=www-data\nWorkingDirectory=/var/www/domain.com/app\nExecStart=/var/www/domain.com/app/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 127.0.0.1:8000 myproject.wsgi:application\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\n3.  Check the permissions:\n\n```bash\nls -l /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service\n```\n\nIf the permissions need fixing:\n\n```bash\nsudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service\n```\n\n----------\n\n### Starting the Gunicorn Service\n\n1.  Enable and start Gunicorn:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl start gunicorn\nsudo systemctl enable gunicorn\n```\n\n\n2.  To check that everything’s working:\n\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl status gunicorn\n``` \n\n----------\n\nAnd that’s it! You’ve successfully set up your Django app with Nginx and Gunicorn. Your app is now ready to handle traffic in production, and you’ve ensured it’s secure and performant. Enjoy the smooth sailing!\n"},{"slug":"new-in-python-django","frontMatter":{"title":"What’s New in Python/Django for 2025?","description":"Ready to dive into the hottest updates in Python and Django for 2025?

If you’re here, you’re probably wondering whether Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Client-Side Rendering (CSR) is the right pick for your next big project. Spoiler alert: there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but don’t worry—I’ve got you covered. Let’s break it all down in simple terms and help you make the call!","image":"/images/blog/ssrvscsr.jpg","date":"2024-12-31","category":"Server"},"content":"\n\nHey there, tech fan! 👋\n\n## What’s the Deal with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?\n\nAlright, here’s the lowdown: SSR means your server does the heavy lifting. When someone visits your site, the server sends them a fully-formed, ready-to-go HTML page.\n\nWhy SSR is Still Cool in 2025 ?\n1. Fast Initial Loads: Your users see the content right away. No waiting around for JavaScript to do its thing. Perfect for folks on slow connections (looking at you, spotty coffee shop Wi-Fi).\n2. SEO Heaven: If you’re building something like a blog, news site, or an online store, SSR makes sure Google can actually see your content. More visibility = more traffic = more mony.\n3. Universal Access: Got users with older browsers or limited JS support? SSR’s got their back.\n\nWhat’s the Catch?\n   - Your server’s gonna feel the heat. Every request means work, so scalability can be tricky.\n   - Dynamic stuff (like those fancy widgets you love) needs extra JavaScript to stay interactive.\n\n## What About Client-Side Rendering (CSR)?\n\nNow, CSR flips the script. The server hands your browser some basic HTML and JavaScript, and the browser takes over, building the page right in front of the user’s eyes.\n\nWhy CSR is the Life of the Party\n1. Smooth & Interactive: CSR shines when you’ve got a lot of dynamic, clicky stuff going on—think admin dashboards or real-time chat apps.\n2. Server-Friendly: Your server can chill while the browser does most of the work. Good for apps with tons of users.\n3. App-Like Vibes: Fast transitions, no page reloads—it feels like a native app.\n\nThe Downsides?\n1. That initial load can feel sloooow. Users on weaker connections might see a blank page before everything kicks in.\n2. Search engines aren’t always thrilled with JavaScript-heavy sites, so you’ll need extra tools to keep them happy.\n\n## Why Not Both? (Hint: You Totally Can)\n\nHere’s the good news: in 2025, you don’t have to pick a side. Hybrid solutions are where it’s at, thanks to frameworks like Next.js, Blazor, and SvelteKit. Let me drop some buzzwords for you:\n\nStatic Site Generation (SSG)\n\nYour pages are pre-built and served super-fast. Great for stuff that doesn’t change every five seconds, like portfolio sites or blogs.\n\nIncremental Static Regeneration (ISR)\n\nImagine getting all the benefits of static pages, but with the ability to update them dynamically as needed. This one’s perfect for online stores or any site with frequently updated content.\n\nPartial Hydration\n\nOnly load JavaScript for the interactive parts of the page. The rest stays snappy and server-rendered. Modern magic, am I right?\n\n## So… How Do You Choose?\n\nHere’s the cheat sheet:\n\nGo SSR if you need:\nLightning-fast initial page loads.\n\nTop-notch SEO for your content.\n\nA global audience with mixed tech setups.\n\nGo CSR if you need:\n\nA super interactive, app-like feel.\n\nReal-time data updates (think dashboards).\n\nTo scale for lots of users without overloading your servers.\n\nGo Hybrid if you want the best of both worlds. Seriously, it’s 2025—why compromise?\n\n## Real-Life Examples\n\nHere’s how I’d play it:\n\nSSR for Blogs and News Sites: Imagine dropping a new blog post about the best coffee spots in California. You want that to load fast and rank high on Google. SSR’s your bestie here.\n\nCSR for Dashboards: Building a project management app for your startup? CSR’s smooth interactivity is exactly what you need.\nHybrid for E-Commerce: Got a shop selling handcrafted surfboards? Use SSR for product pages (SEO gold!) and CSR for that interactive shopping cart.\n\n\n## Wrap-Up: SSR vs. CSR—Who Wins?\n\nThe real winner? Your users. Picking the right approach depends on what you’re building and who you’re building it for. The cool thing is, frameworks in 2025 make it easier than ever to mix and match.\n\nStill on the fence? Hit me up in the comments, or check out tools like Next.js, Blazor, or Astro—they’re game changers.\n\nAlright, that’s it for today! Now go out there and build something amazing.
