We'll walk you through everything from installing the necessary packages to configuring your environment to run Django in production. Let's get started!","image":"/images/blog/django.jpg","date":"2025-01-04","category":"Server"},"content":"\n\n## Preparing the Server\n\nFirst things first: we need to update your server and install the essential packages.\n\n -  Run these commands to update and install everything you need:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\nsudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev libpq-dev nginx -y\n```\n\nHere’s what each package is for:\n\n- `python3-pip`: The tool that lets you install Python packages you’ll need for your app.\n    \n- `python3-venv`: Allows you to create a virtual environment for Python—this keeps things nice and clean.\n    \n- `python3-dev`: Development headers and libraries for building Python packages.\n    \n- `libpq-dev`: Required for connecting your Django app to PostgreSQL if you're using that as your database.\n    \n-  `nginx`: This is the web server we’re going to use to serve your Django app.\n\n----------\n\n### Creating the App Directory\n\nNow let’s create the directory where your Django app will live and set the right permissions.\n\n1.  Make the directory:\n\n```bash\nsudo mkdir -p /var/www/domain.com/app\n```\n2.  Set the correct permissions:\n\n```bash\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/domain.com/app\nsudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/domain.com\n``` \nWhat’s happening here:\n-   `mkdir -p`: Makes sure all the necessary folders are created (even the ones in the path).\n  \n-   `chown`: Changes the ownership of the directory to the current user (you).\n  \n-  `chmod`: Ensures the right read/execute permissions for the directory.\n\n----------\n\n### Configuring Nginx for Your App\n\nNow it’s time to set up Nginx to serve your Django app. Let’s create a configuration file for your domain.\n\n1.  Create the config file:\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/domain.com\n```\n\n2.  Add the following content to the file:\n\n\n```bash\n`server {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name domain.com www.domain.com;\n\n    root /var/www/domain.com/html;\n    index index.html;\n\n    location / {\n        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;\n    }\n}` \n```\nWhat’s happening here:\n -   `listen 80`: Tells Nginx to listen for HTTP traffic on port 80 (the standard for web traffic).\n    \n -   `server_name`: This specifies which domains Nginx should handle with this config.\n   \n -  `try_files`: It checks if the requested files exist. If not, it returns a 404 error.\n\n----------\n\n### Setting Up SSL with Let's Encrypt\n\nFor added security, you should use HTTPS. If you don’t already have an SSL certificate, Let’s Encrypt is a free, trusted option.\n\n1.  First, let’s redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS:\n\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name domain.com www.domain.com;\n    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n}\n```\n\n2.  Next, let’s set up the HTTPS server configuration:\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl;\n    server_name domain.com www.domain.com;\n\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/fullchain.pem;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/privkey.pem;\n    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;\n    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n    }\n\n    location /static/ {\n        alias /var/www/domain.com/app/static/;\n    }\n}\n``` \n\n Here’s what’s going on:\n-   `proxy_pass`: This tells Nginx to forward incoming requests to Gunicorn (which will run your Django app on port 8000).\n    \n-   `alias`: This directs Nginx to the static files folder where your Django app will store its static assets.\n\n----------\n\n### Activating the Nginx Configuration and Restarting the Service\n\nNow that we’ve got Nginx set up, let’s activate the configuration and restart Nginx.\n\n1.  Enable the site by creating a symbolic link:\n\n```bash\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/domain.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` \n```\n\n2.  Check for configuration errors:\n```bash\nsudo nginx -t\n```\n\n3.  If everything checks out, restart Nginx:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart nginx\n```\n\n----------\n\n## Setting Up the Django Project\n\nNext, let’s get your Django project set up and ready to go!\n\n1.  Create a virtual environment for Python:\n\n```bash\ncd /var/www/domain.com/app\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate \n```\n\n2.  Install Django and Gunicorn:\n\n```bash\npip install django gunicorn \n```\n\n----------\n\n### Creating the Django Project\n\n1.  Now, let’s create a new Django project:\n\n```bash\ndjango-admin startproject myproject .\n```\n\n2.  To test that everything’s running, start the Django development server:\n\n```bash\npython3 manage.py runserver\n```\n\n----------\n\n### Configuring Static Files\n\n1.  Create the static files directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /var/www/domain.com/app/static\n```\n\n2.  Update `settings.py` to point to the correct location for static files:\n\n\n```bash\nSTATIC_ROOT = \"/var/www/domain.com/app/static/\"\nSTATIC_URL = \"/static/\"\n```\n\n3.  Collect all the static files:\n```bash\npython manage.py collectstatic\n```\n-----------\n#### In Django, handling static files—like CSS, JavaScript, and images—requires special attention because of how static content is served in production versus development. Let’s break it down:\n\nWhy Static Files Need Configuration ?\n\nBy default, Django is optimized for development, and during development, it automatically serves static files using its built-in development server. However, this approach isn't suitable for production due to performance and security concerns. Instead:\n\nIn Development:\n\n   - Django's development server (e.g., when you run python manage.py runserver) handles static files directly, pulling them from the STATICFILES_DIRS or app-specific static folders (<app_name>/static).\nYou don't need to create or configure STATIC_ROOT or manually run collectstatic.\n\nIn Production:\n\n   - A web server like Nginx or Apache should serve static files. This ensures better performance since serving static assets isn’t what Django’s application server (like Gunicorn) is designed for.\nDjango needs all static files from various apps to be gathered into a single directory, specified by STATIC_ROOT. This is why the collectstatic command is necessary.\nWithout a properly set STATIC_ROOT, you can't collect and serve static files efficiently in production.\n\nWhy Create the Directory Manually?\n\n   - The directory defined by STATIC_ROOT (e.g., /var/www/domain.com/app/static/) is where Django collects all static files when you run:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py collectstatic\n```\n\nYou need to create this directory manually because:\n\n1. It's not automatically created by Django: Django only expects the STATIC_ROOT setting to point to an existing location.\n  \n2. Flexibility in deployment: You might want the static directory to be in a specific location, independent of Django’s project structure. For example, /var/www/... is commonly used in production setups.\n   \nDo You Need This in Both Production and Development?\n   - In Production: Yes, always. The STATIC_ROOT directory and the collectstatic process are essential in production environments because Django doesn’t serve static files directly. Instead, the web server (e.g., Nginx) will use the collected files.\n   - In Development: Not typically. Django's development server handles static files automatically using the STATICFILES_DIRS and app-specific static folders. You don't need to configure STATIC_ROOT or run collectstatic.\n\nIf you're testing a production-like environment locally, you might set it up in development to mirror production, but it’s optional.\n\n#### Key Takeaway\n\nThe manual creation of the STATIC_ROOT directory and running collectstatic are production-specific requirements. In development, Django simplifies the process, but in production, separating the app logic from static file serving is critical for performance and scalability.\n\n-----------\n4.  Set the right permissions on the static files folder:\n\n```bash\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/domain.com/app/static\nsudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/domain.com/app/static\n```\n\n\n\n### Setting Up the Gunicorn Service\n\nGunicorn will serve your Django app, so let’s set it up with a systemd service.\n\n1.  Create the Gunicorn service file:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service\n```\n\n2.  Add the following configuration:\n\n```bash\n[Unit]\nDescription=gunicorn daemon for Django project\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=www-data\nGroup=www-data\nWorkingDirectory=/var/www/domain.com/app\nExecStart=/var/www/domain.com/app/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 127.0.0.1:8000 myproject.wsgi:application\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\n3.  Check the permissions:\n\n```bash\nls -l /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service\n```\n\nIf the permissions need fixing:\n\n```bash\nsudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service\n```\n\n----------\n\n### Starting the Gunicorn Service\n\n1.  Enable and start Gunicorn:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl start gunicorn\nsudo systemctl enable gunicorn\n```\n\n\n2.  To check that everything’s working:\n\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl status gunicorn\n``` \n\n----------\n\nAnd that’s it! You’ve successfully set up your Django app with Nginx and Gunicorn. Your app is now ready to handle traffic in production, and you’ve ensured it’s secure and performant. Enjoy the smooth sailing!\n"},"previousPost":{"slug":"cerbot","frontMatter":{"title":"How to Install and Use Let's Encrypt SSL on Your Server (Apache & Nginx)","description":"Certbot is the recommended client for obtaining and renewing SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt. The installation process depends on your Linux distribution (or operating system), but the following steps are for Ubuntu. The process is similar for other distributions.","image":"/images/blog/cerbot.jpg","date":"2024-12-20","category":"Server"},"content":"\nLet’s Encrypt uses Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol to automate the process of obtaining and installing SSL certificates. The most common ACME client is Certbot, which is responsible for obtaining the certificates from Let’s Encrypt and configuring the server.\n\nLet’s Encrypt certificates are domain-validated certificates, meaning they only verify the ownership of the domain and not the identity of the organization behind it. This is why they are ideal for personal blogs, small businesses, or any website that doesn’t require extended validation (EV) certificates.\n\n## Install Certbot\n## On Ubuntu/Debian.\nUpdate existing packages:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\n```\n## Install Certbot and the plugin for Nginx or Apache (depending on your web server):\n\nFor Nginx:\n```bash\nsudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx\n```\n\nFor Apache:\n```bash\nsudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache\n```\n\n## On CentOS/RHEL.\nInstall EPEL repository (for CentOS 7 and below):\n\n```bash\nsudo yum install epel-release\n```\n\n\nInstall Certbot:\n\n```bash\nsudo yum install certbot python2-certbot-nginx\n```\n## Obtain the SSL Certificate\nAfter installation, you can obtain an SSL certificate for your domain. Certbot will automatically check if your domain is configured correctly and request the certificate from Let's Encrypt.\n\nFor Nginx:\n```bash\nsudo certbot --nginx\n```\n\nFor Apache:\n```bash\nsudo certbot --apache\n```\nCertbot will ask you to enter your email address and accept the terms and conditions. It will then automatically verify your domain and configure the web server to use the SSL certificate.\n\nSet Up Automatic Certificate Renewal\nLet's Encrypt certificates are valid for only 90 days. It’s important to set up automatic renewal.\n\nCertbot includes a cron job to handle automatic renewals, but you can check it by running:\n\n```bash\nsudo certbot renew --dry-run\n```\nThis simulates the renewal process and will show you if everything is working fine.\n\n## Check the Installation\nOnce you've configured Let's Encrypt, you can check that SSL is working by accessing your site using https:// in front of your domain. You can also verify with an online tool like SSL Labs.\n\nConfigure HTTP to HTTPS Redirection\nTo ensure that all visitors to your site are using HTTPS, you should redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. If you used the Certbot plugin for Nginx or Apache, it will automatically configure this redirection.\n\n\n1. For Nginx:\n\nExample of SSL Configuration in Nginx (yourdomain.com.conf):\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;\n    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n}\n\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl;\n    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;\n\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;\n\n    location / {\n        root /var/www/yourdomain;\n        index index.html index.php; #etc\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nIn the server block configuration (usually /etc/nginx/sites-available/default), add a section for HTTP to HTTPS redirection:\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;\n    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n}\n```\n\n2. For Apache:\n\nIn your Apache configuration file (located in /etc/apache2/sites-available/), ensure there’s a VirtualHost block for HTTPS (port 443) and an HTTP to HTTPS redirection block.\n\nExample of SSL Configuration in Apache (default-ssl.conf):\n\n```bash\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@yourdomain.com\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/yourdomain\n    ServerName yourdomain.com\n    ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com\n\n    SSLEngine on\n    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem\n    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem\n    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/chain.pem\n\n    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\n    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n\n    # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS\n    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\n        RewriteEngine On\n        RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off\n        RewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]\n    </IfModule>\n</VirtualHost>\n\n```\n\nThen enable SSL and the default-ssl site configuration:\n\n```bash\nsudo a2enmod ssl\nsudo a2ensite default-ssl\nsudo systemctl restart apache2\n\n```\nAdd this rule in your .htaccess file or Apache configuration:\n\n```bash\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} off\nRewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]\n```\n\n\nPeriodically Check Certificates\nSetting up and using Let's Encrypt SSL certificates is a straightforward process with Certbot, ensuring that your website traffic is encrypted and secure. Whether you're using Apache or Nginx, this guide provides the necessary steps to configure SSL and redirect HTTP to HTTPS.\n\nBy regularly checking your SSL certificates and ensuring automatic renewals, you can maintain a secure and trusted website for your visitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"nextPost":{"slug":"new-in-python-django","frontMatter":{"title":"What’s New in Python/Django for 2025?","description":"Ready to dive into the hottest updates in Python and Django for 2025?
