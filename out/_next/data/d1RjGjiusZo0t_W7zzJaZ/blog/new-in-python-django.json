We'll walk you through everything from installing the necessary packages to configuring your environment to run Django in production. Let's get started!","image":"/images/blog/django.jpg","date":"2025-01-04","category":"Server"},"content":"\n\n## Preparing the Server\n\nFirst things first: we need to update your server and install the essential packages.\n\n -  Run these commands to update and install everything you need:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\nsudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev libpq-dev nginx -y\n```\n\nHereâ€™s what each package is for:\n\n- `python3-pip`: The tool that lets you install Python packages youâ€™ll need for your app.\n    \n- `python3-venv`: Allows you to create a virtual environment for Pythonâ€”this keeps things nice and clean.\n    \n- `python3-dev`: Development headers and libraries for building Python packages.\n    \n- `libpq-dev`: Required for connecting your Django app to PostgreSQL if you're using that as your database.\n    \n-  `nginx`: This is the web server weâ€™re going to use to serve your Django app.\n\n----------\n\n### Creating the App Directory\n\nNow letâ€™s create the directory where your Django app will live and set the right permissions.\n\n1.  Make the directory:\n\n```bash\nsudo mkdir -p /var/www/domain.com/app\n```\n2.  Set the correct permissions:\n\n```bash\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/domain.com/app\nsudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/domain.com\n``` \nWhatâ€™s happening here:\n-   `mkdir -p`: Makes sure all the necessary folders are created (even the ones in the path).\n  \n-   `chown`: Changes the ownership of the directory to the current user (you).\n  \n-  `chmod`: Ensures the right read/execute permissions for the directory.\n\n----------\n\n### Configuring Nginx for Your App\n\nNow itâ€™s time to set up Nginx to serve your Django app. Letâ€™s create a configuration file for your domain.\n\n1.  Create the config file:\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/domain.com\n```\n\n2.  Add the following content to the file:\n\n\n```bash\n`server {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name domain.com www.domain.com;\n\n    root /var/www/domain.com/html;\n    index index.html;\n\n    location / {\n        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;\n    }\n}` \n```\nWhatâ€™s happening here:\n -   `listen 80`: Tells Nginx to listen for HTTP traffic on port 80 (the standard for web traffic).\n    \n -   `server_name`: This specifies which domains Nginx should handle with this config.\n   \n -  `try_files`: It checks if the requested files exist. If not, it returns a 404 error.\n\n----------\n\n### Setting Up SSL with Let's Encrypt\n\nFor added security, you should use HTTPS. If you donâ€™t already have an SSL certificate, Letâ€™s Encrypt is a free, trusted option.\n\n1.  First, letâ€™s redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS:\n\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name domain.com www.domain.com;\n    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n}\n```\n\n2.  Next, letâ€™s set up the HTTPS server configuration:\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl;\n    server_name domain.com www.domain.com;\n\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/fullchain.pem;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/privkey.pem;\n    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;\n    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n    }\n\n    location /static/ {\n        alias /var/www/domain.com/app/static/;\n    }\n}\n``` \n\n Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s going on:\n-   `proxy_pass`: This tells Nginx to forward incoming requests to Gunicorn (which will run your Django app on port 8000).\n    \n-   `alias`: This directs Nginx to the static files folder where your Django app will store its static assets.\n\n----------\n\n### Activating the Nginx Configuration and Restarting the Service\n\nNow that weâ€™ve got Nginx set up, letâ€™s activate the configuration and restart Nginx.\n\n1.  Enable the site by creating a symbolic link:\n\n```bash\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/domain.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` \n```\n\n2.  Check for configuration errors:\n```bash\nsudo nginx -t\n```\n\n3.  If everything checks out, restart Nginx:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart nginx\n```\n\n----------\n\n## Setting Up the Django Project\n\nNext, letâ€™s get your Django project set up and ready to go!\n\n1.  Create a virtual environment for Python:\n\n```bash\ncd /var/www/domain.com/app\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate \n```\n\n2.  Install Django and Gunicorn:\n\n```bash\npip install django gunicorn \n```\n\n----------\n\n### Creating the Django Project\n\n1.  Now, letâ€™s create a new Django project:\n\n```bash\ndjango-admin startproject myproject .\n```\n\n2.  To test that everythingâ€™s running, start the Django development server:\n\n```bash\npython3 manage.py runserver\n```\n\n----------\n\n### Configuring Static Files\n\n1.  Create the static files directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /var/www/domain.com/app/static\n```\n\n2.  Update `settings.py` to point to the correct location for static files:\n\n\n```bash\nSTATIC_ROOT = \"/var/www/domain.com/app/static/\"\nSTATIC_URL = \"/static/\"\n```\n\n3.  Collect all the static files:\n```bash\npython manage.py collectstatic\n```\n-----------\n#### In Django, handling static filesâ€”like CSS, JavaScript, and imagesâ€”requires special attention because of how static content is served in production versus development. Letâ€™s break it down:\n\nWhy Static Files Need Configuration ?\n\nBy default, Django is optimized for development, and during development, it automatically serves static files using its built-in development server. However, this approach isn't suitable for production due to performance and security concerns. Instead:\n\nIn Development:\n\n   - Django's development server (e.g., when you run python manage.py runserver) handles static files directly, pulling them from the STATICFILES_DIRS or app-specific static folders (<app_name>/static).\nYou don't need to create or configure STATIC_ROOT or manually run collectstatic.\n\nIn Production:\n\n   - A web server like Nginx or Apache should serve static files. This ensures better performance since serving static assets isnâ€™t what Djangoâ€™s application server (like Gunicorn) is designed for.\nDjango needs all static files from various apps to be gathered into a single directory, specified by STATIC_ROOT. This is why the collectstatic command is necessary.\nWithout a properly set STATIC_ROOT, you can't collect and serve static files efficiently in production.\n\nWhy Create the Directory Manually?\n\n   - The directory defined by STATIC_ROOT (e.g., /var/www/domain.com/app/static/) is where Django collects all static files when you run:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py collectstatic\n```\n\nYou need to create this directory manually because:\n\n1. It's not automatically created by Django: Django only expects the STATIC_ROOT setting to point to an existing location.\n  \n2. Flexibility in deployment: You might want the static directory to be in a specific location, independent of Djangoâ€™s project structure. For example, /var/www/... is commonly used in production setups.\n   \nDo You Need This in Both Production and Development?\n   - In Production: Yes, always. The STATIC_ROOT directory and the collectstatic process are essential in production environments because Django doesnâ€™t serve static files directly. Instead, the web server (e.g., Nginx) will use the collected files.\n   - In Development: Not typically. Django's development server handles static files automatically using the STATICFILES_DIRS and app-specific static folders. You don't need to configure STATIC_ROOT or run collectstatic.\n\nIf you're testing a production-like environment locally, you might set it up in development to mirror production, but itâ€™s optional.\n\n#### Key Takeaway\n\nThe manual creation of the STATIC_ROOT directory and running collectstatic are production-specific requirements. In development, Django simplifies the process, but in production, separating the app logic from static file serving is critical for performance and scalability.\n\n-----------\n4.  Set the right permissions on the static files folder:\n\n```bash\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/domain.com/app/static\nsudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/domain.com/app/static\n```\n\n\n\n### Setting Up the Gunicorn Service\n\nGunicorn will serve your Django app, so letâ€™s set it up with a systemd service.\n\n1.  Create the Gunicorn service file:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service\n```\n\n2.  Add the following configuration:\n\n```bash\n[Unit]\nDescription=gunicorn daemon for Django project\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=www-data\nGroup=www-data\nWorkingDirectory=/var/www/domain.com/app\nExecStart=/var/www/domain.com/app/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 127.0.0.1:8000 myproject.wsgi:application\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\n3.  Check the permissions:\n\n```bash\nls -l /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service\n```\n\nIf the permissions need fixing:\n\n```bash\nsudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service\n```\n\n----------\n\n### Starting the Gunicorn Service\n\n1.  Enable and start Gunicorn:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl start gunicorn\nsudo systemctl enable gunicorn\n```\n\n\n2.  To check that everythingâ€™s working:\n\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl status gunicorn\n``` \n\n----------\n\nAnd thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ve successfully set up your Django app with Nginx and Gunicorn. Your app is now ready to handle traffic in production, and youâ€™ve ensured itâ€™s secure and performant. Enjoy the smooth sailing!\n"},"nextPost":{"slug":"server-side-vs-client-side","frontMatter":{"title":"Server-Side vs. Client-Side Rendering: Which One to Choose in 2025?","description":"Itâ€™s 2025, and the web dev world just keeps moving faster than my morning coffee routine in SoCal. If youâ€™re here, youâ€™re probably wondering whether Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Client-Side Rendering (CSR) is the right pick for your next big project. Spoiler alert: thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all answer, but donâ€™t worryâ€”Iâ€™ve got you covered. Letâ€™s break it all down in simple terms and help you make the call!","image":"/images/blog/ssrvscsr.jpg","date":"2024-12-31","category":"Server"},"content":"\n\nHey there, tech fan! ðŸ‘‹\n\n## Whatâ€™s the Deal with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?\n\nAlright, hereâ€™s the lowdown: SSR means your server does the heavy lifting. When someone visits your site, the server sends them a fully-formed, ready-to-go HTML page.\n\nWhy SSR is Still Cool in 2025 ?\n1. Fast Initial Loads: Your users see the content right away. No waiting around for JavaScript to do its thing. Perfect for folks on slow connections (looking at you, spotty coffee shop Wi-Fi).\n2. SEO Heaven: If youâ€™re building something like a blog, news site, or an online store, SSR makes sure Google can actually see your content. More visibility = more traffic = more mony.\n3. Universal Access: Got users with older browsers or limited JS support? SSRâ€™s got their back.\n\nWhatâ€™s the Catch?\n   - Your serverâ€™s gonna feel the heat. Every request means work, so scalability can be tricky.\n   - Dynamic stuff (like those fancy widgets you love) needs extra JavaScript to stay interactive.\n\n## What About Client-Side Rendering (CSR)?\n\nNow, CSR flips the script. The server hands your browser some basic HTML and JavaScript, and the browser takes over, building the page right in front of the userâ€™s eyes.\n\nWhy CSR is the Life of the Party\n1. Smooth & Interactive: CSR shines when youâ€™ve got a lot of dynamic, clicky stuff going onâ€”think admin dashboards or real-time chat apps.\n2. Server-Friendly: Your server can chill while the browser does most of the work. Good for apps with tons of users.\n3. App-Like Vibes: Fast transitions, no page reloadsâ€”it feels like a native app.\n\nThe Downsides?\n1. That initial load can feel sloooow. Users on weaker connections might see a blank page before everything kicks in.\n2. Search engines arenâ€™t always thrilled with JavaScript-heavy sites, so youâ€™ll need extra tools to keep them happy.\n\n## Why Not Both? (Hint: You Totally Can)\n\nHereâ€™s the good news: in 2025, you donâ€™t have to pick a side. Hybrid solutions are where itâ€™s at, thanks to frameworks like Next.js, Blazor, and SvelteKit. Let me drop some buzzwords for you:\n\nStatic Site Generation (SSG)\n\nYour pages are pre-built and served super-fast. Great for stuff that doesnâ€™t change every five seconds, like portfolio sites or blogs.\n\nIncremental Static Regeneration (ISR)\n\nImagine getting all the benefits of static pages, but with the ability to update them dynamically as needed. This oneâ€™s perfect for online stores or any site with frequently updated content.\n\nPartial Hydration\n\nOnly load JavaScript for the interactive parts of the page. The rest stays snappy and server-rendered. Modern magic, am I right?\n\n## Soâ€¦ How Do You Choose?\n\nHereâ€™s the cheat sheet:\n\nGo SSR if you need:\nLightning-fast initial page loads.\n\nTop-notch SEO for your content.\n\nA global audience with mixed tech setups.\n\nGo CSR if you need:\n\nA super interactive, app-like feel.\n\nReal-time data updates (think dashboards).\n\nTo scale for lots of users without overloading your servers.\n\nGo Hybrid if you want the best of both worlds. Seriously, itâ€™s 2025â€”why compromise?\n\n## Real-Life Examples\n\nHereâ€™s how Iâ€™d play it:\n\nSSR for Blogs and News Sites: Imagine dropping a new blog post about the best coffee spots in California. You want that to load fast and rank high on Google. SSRâ€™s your bestie here.\n\nCSR for Dashboards: Building a project management app for your startup? CSRâ€™s smooth interactivity is exactly what you need.\nHybrid for E-Commerce: Got a shop selling handcrafted surfboards? Use SSR for product pages (SEO gold!) and CSR for that interactive shopping cart.\n\n\n## Wrap-Up: SSR vs. CSRâ€”Who Wins?\n\nThe real winner? Your users. Picking the right approach depends on what youâ€™re building and who youâ€™re building it for. The cool thing is, frameworks in 2025 make it easier than ever to mix and match.\n\nStill on the fence? Hit me up in the comments, or check out tools like Next.js, Blazor, or Astroâ€”theyâ€™re game changers.\n\nAlright, thatâ€™s it for today! Now go out there and build something amazing. And hey, if youâ€™re in California, letâ€™s grab a coffee and talk tech. â˜•\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
