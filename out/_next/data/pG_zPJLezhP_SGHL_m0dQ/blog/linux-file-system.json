Enable commonly used ones:\n\n```bash\nmicrok8s enable dns dashboard storage\n```\n\nThese will enable internal DNS, the Kubernetes dashboard, and storage.\n\nStep 4: Check Cluster Status\nEnsure everything is set up correctly:\n\n```bash\nmicrok8s status --wait-ready\n```\n\n\n## Installing and Configuring K3s\nStep 1: Install the Master Node\nOn the main (master) node, run the following command to install K3s:\n\n```bash\ncurl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -\n```\n\nThis will download and automatically configure K3s. A kubeconfig file will be generated and can be found at /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml.\n\nStep 2: Get the Token\nTo add worker nodes, you’ll need the token generated during installation. Retrieve it with:\n\n```bash\ncat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token\n```\n\nStep 3: Add Worker Nodes\nOn each worker node, install K3s and connect it to the master:\n```bash\ncurl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://<MASTER_IP>:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<TOKEN> sh -\n```\n\nStep 4: Verify the Cluster\nOn the master node, verify the connected nodes:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get nodes\n```\n\n## Testing the Cluster\nTo confirm that your cluster is working correctly, deploy a simple application:\n\n```bash\nkubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx\nkubectl expose deployment nginx --type=NodePort --port=80\n```\n\nFind the exposed port using:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get services\n```\nAccess the application at http://<NODE_IP>:<PORT>.\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues in Kubernetes Clusters\n\nEven with a solid Kubernetes setup, issues are bound to arise. Here are some of the most common problems and how to address them effectively:\n\n1. DNS Issues in MicroK8s\nIf DNS isn’t working:\n  - Check if CoreDNS is running:\n```bash\nmicrok8s kubectl get pods -n kube-system\n```  \n\n  - If it's in CrashLoopBackOff, check the logs:\n```bash \nmicrok8s kubectl logs -n kube-system <coredns-pod-name>  \n```\n\n  - Ensure that iptables isn’t blocking DNS traffic:\n```bash\nsudo iptables -F  \n```\n\n2. Worker Nodes Not Connecting in K3s\nIf a worker node isn’t showing up in kubectl get nodes:\n\n   - Verify that you’re using the correct URL and token from the master node:\n```bash\ncat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token  \n```\n\nOpen port 6443 on the master node:\n```bash\nsudo ufw allow 6443/tcp\n```\n3. Service Inaccessible\nIf your applications are unreachable:\n\n  - Check the NodePort for your service:\n```bash\nkubectl get services\n```\n  - Ensure readiness probes are properly configured:\n```bash\nkubectl describe pod <pod-name>  \n```\n\n  - Open the NodePort range (30000-32767):\n```bash\nsudo ufw allow 30000:32767/tcp  \n```\n\n4. Cluster Nodes in ‘NotReady’ State\nIf nodes are marked as NotReady:\n\n   - Check hardware resources:\n```bash\nfree -h\n```\n\n  - Make sure the container runtime (e.g., Docker/Containerd) is running:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart docker\n```\n\n   - Reinstall networking plugins:\n```bash\nmicrok8s enable dns flannel  \n```\n\n5. Pods Stuck in Pending State\nWhen pods can’t be scheduled:\n\n   - Inspect events for the pod:\n```bash\nkubectl describe pod <pod-name>  \n```\n\n   - Remove unnecessary taints from nodes:\n```bash\nkubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:NoSchedule-  \n```\n\nThese tips will help you quickly diagnose and resolve most Kubernetes cluster issues. The key is to dive into logs and system events to pinpoint where things are breaking down. Good luck!
