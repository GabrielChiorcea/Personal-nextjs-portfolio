React: The main library used for building the user interface.\n2. Redux: State management to ensure a smooth and consistent user experience.\n3. Firebase: Used for authentication and real-time data storage.\n4. React Router: Manages routing and navigation within the application.\n5. Styled Components: Styles React components to create a modern and attractive interface.\n6. Material-UI: A UI component library to accelerate development and ensure design consistency.\n\n## Project Structure\nComponents: Contains all reusable components of the application, such as buttons, forms, and lists.\nPages: Contains the main pages of the application, such as the menu page, cart page, and admin page.\nStore: Contains the Redux configuration and reducers for managing the application's state.\nFirebase: Configuration for Firebase authentication and data storage.\n\n## Redux :\n\n\n```javascript\n\nimport { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';\n\nconst initialCartState = {\n  items: [],\n  meals: [],\n  totalAmount: 0,\n  isAdmin: false,\n  stockButton: false,\n  productButton: false,\n  orderButton: true\n\n};\n\nconst orderSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'order',\n  initialState: initialCartState,\n  reducers: {\n    addItem(state, action) {\n      const newItem = action.payload;\n      const existingItem = state.items.find(item => item.id === newItem.id);\n      state.totalAmount += newItem.price * newItem.amount;\n      if (!existingItem) {\n        state.items.push({\n          id: newItem.id,\n          name: newItem.name,\n          amount: newItem.amount,\n          price: newItem.price,\n        });\n      } else {\n        existingItem.amount += newItem.amount;\n      }\n    },\n    removeItem(state, action) {\n      const id = action.payload;\n      const existingItem = state.items.find(item => item.id === id);\n      state.totalAmount -= existingItem.price;\n      if (existingItem.amount === 1) {\n        state.items = state.items.filter(item => item.id !== id);\n      } else {\n        existingItem.amount--;\n      }\n    },\n    addMeal(state, action) {\n      const newMeal = action.payload;\n      const existingMeal = state.meals.find(meal => meal.id === newMeal.id);\n      if (!existingMeal) {\n        state.meals.push({\n          id: newMeal.id,\n          name: newMeal.name,\n          description: newMeal.description,\n          price: newMeal.price,\n          availability: newMeal.availability,\n        });\n      }\n    },\n    clearCart(state) {\n      state.items = [];\n      state.totalAmount = 0;\n    },\n    loginAdmin(state, action) {\n      state.isAdmin = action.payload;\n    },\n\n    setStockButton(state, action) {\n      state.stockButton = action.payload;\n    },\n\n    setProductButton(state, action) {\n      state.productButton = action.payload;\n    },\n\n    setOrderButton(state, action) {\n      state.orderButton = action.payload;\n    }\n  },\n});\n\nexport const orderActions = orderSlice.actions;\nexport default orderSlice.reducer;\n\n```\n\n1. The order-slice.js file defines the initial state and the reducers for managing the cart state.\n2. The createSlice function from Redux Toolkit is used to create a slice of the state, which includes actions and reducers.\n3. The initial state includes properties like items, meals, totalAmount, isAdmin, stockButton, productButton, and orderButton.\n4. The reducers define how the state should be updated in response to actions. For example, the addItem reducer adds a new item to the cart, and the removeItem reducer removes an item from the cart.\n\n## Configuring the Redux Store:\n\nThe index.js file in the store directory configures the Redux store using the configureStore function from Redux Toolkit. The store is configured with the orderReducer created in the order-slice.js file.\n\nProviding the Redux Store to the Application:\nThe index.js file in the root directory wraps the App component with the Provider component from react-redux and passes the store to it.\nThis makes the Redux store available to all components in the application.\n\nBy using Redux for state management, the React Meals application ensures a predictable and efficient way to manage the application state. Redux helps in maintaining a single source of truth for the state, making it easier to debug and test the application. The use of Redux Toolkit simplifies the setup and reduces boilerplate code, allowing for a more streamlined development process.\n\n\n\n\n"},"nextProject":{"slug":"checker","frontMatter":{"date":"2023-11-11","title":"Checker","lang":"Build with C#","description":"This project is an interactive web application developed with Blazor WebAssembly, utilizing Fluxor for state management and including custom services for authentication and handling HTTP requests.","image":"/images/project/03.jpg","color":"#BF4106","category":"Frontend","projectInfo":[{"title":"Client","data":"World wide"},{"title":"Timeline","data":"In progress, but ready for tests"},{"title":"Tehnology","data":"- Blazor\n- Fluxor \n- Bootstrap  \n"},{"title":"Functions","data":"- Post Like\n- User Account\n- Activity track\n- Share post \n"}],"live":[{"link":"https://checker.gabrielchiorcea.tech/"}]},"content":"\r\n\r\n<div className=\"image columns-1 sm:columns-2 gap-8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n![C# 02.](/images/project/03-02.jpg)\r\n![C# 01.](/images/project/03-01.jpg)\r\n![C# 03.](/images/project/03-03.jpg)\r\n![C# 03.](/images/project/03-04.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Project Overview\r\n\r\nChecker is a web application designed to manage user profiles and account settings.

This state could include information such as the user's profile details, loading status, and any errors.\r\n\r\nDescription\r\nProfileCardState Definition:\r\n\r\nThe ProfileCardState class is defined in the State.cs file. It includes properties like HomeAddress, Country, County, Occupation, FullName, Email, Image, and various social media links.\r\n```C#\r\npublic class ProfileCardState\r\n{\r\n    public string HomeAddress { get; set; }\r\n    public string Country { get; set; }\r\n    public string County { get; set; }\r\n    public string Occupation { get; set; }\r\n    public string FullName { get; set; }\r\n    public string Email { get; set; }\r\n    public byte[] Image { get; set; }\r\n    public string LinkedIn { get; set; }\r\n    public string FaceBook { get; set; }\r\n    public string GitHub { get; set; }\r\n    public string Instagram { get; set; }\r\n    public string Twitter { get; set; }\r\n    public string Youtube { get; set; }\r\n    public string Description { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public ProfileCardState(string homeAddress, string country, string county, string occupation, string fullname, string email, byte[] image, string linkedIn, string faceBook, string gitHub, string instagram, string twitter, string youtube, string description)\r\n    {\r\n        HomeAddress = homeAddress;\r\n        Country = country;\r\n        County = county;\r\n        Occupation = occupation;\r\n        Image = image;\r\n        FullName = fullname;\r\n        Email = email;\r\n        LinkedIn = linkedIn;\r\n        FaceBook = faceBook;\r\n        GitHub = gitHub;\r\n        Instagram = instagram;\r\n        Twitter = twitter;\r\n        Youtube = youtube;\r\n        Description = description;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public ProfileCardState() { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has constructors to initialize these properties, including a parameterless constructor for flexibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeature Initialization:\r\n\r\nThe ProfileCardFeature class, defined in the Feature.cs file, specifies the initial state of ProfileCardState with default values.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nusing Fluxor;\r\n\r\nnamespace Checker.state\r\n{\r\n    public class ProfileCardFeature : Feature<ProfileCardState>\r\n    {\r\n        public override string GetName() => \"ProfileCard\";\r\n\r\n        protected override ProfileCardState GetInitialState() =>\r\n            new ProfileCardState(\r\n                string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, new byte[0], \r\n                string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, string.Empty, \r\n                string.Empty\r\n            );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nReducers:\r\n\r\nThe ProfileCardReducer class, found in the Reducers.cs file, handles state changes. The ReduceProfileCard method updates the state based on the GetProfileCardState action by creating a new ProfileCardState with updated values.\r\n```C#\r\nusing Fluxor;\r\n\r\nnamespace Checker.state\r\n{\r\n    public static class ProfileCardReducer\r\n    {\r\n        [ReducerMethod]\r\n        public static ProfileCardState ReduceProfileCard(ProfileCardState state, GetProfileCardState action)\r\n        {\r\n            return new ProfileCardState(\r\n                action.State.HomeAddress,\r\n                action.State.Country,\r\n                action.State.County,\r\n                action.State.Occupation,\r\n                action.State.FullName,\r\n                action.State.Email,            \r\n                action.State.Image,\r\n                action.State.LinkedIn,\r\n                action.State.FaceBook,\r\n                action.State.GitHub,\r\n                action.State.Instagram,\r\n                action.State.Twitter,\r\n                action.State.Youtube,\r\n                action.State.Description\r\n            );\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage in Components:\r\n\r\nIn various Razor components like ProfileRender.razor, HomeRender.razor, and AdminRender.razor, the ProfileCardState is injected and used to display profile information.\r\nThese components fetch user data from the server and dispatch actions to update the state. For example, when the profile page is loaded, it checks the authentication token and fetches the user's profile data to update the state.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n@page \"/profile\"\r\n\r\n@using Checker.Pages.Message\r\n@using global::Checker.state\r\n@using global::Checker.Models \r\n@using global::Checker.Services\r\n@using global::Checker.features\r\n@using Fluxor\r\n@inject AuthenticationTocken authenticationtocken\r\n@inject IState<ProfileCardState> ProfileCardState\r\n\r\n@inject FetchService fetchService\r\n@inject IDispatcher Dispatcher\r\n\r\n@if(error == false){\r\n    @if(isLoading){\r\n        <BlazorChecking/>\r\n    } else if(tokenState){\r\n        <ProfileDom/>\r\n    }else{\r\n        <Restricted/>\r\n    }\r\n}else{\r\n    <BlazorError/>\r\n}\r\n\r\n@code{\r\n    bool isLoading = true;\r\n    bool error = false;\r\n    bool tokenState;\r\n    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()\r\n    {\r\n        tokenState = await authenticationtocken.Check();\r\n        \r\n        if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(ProfileCardState.Value.FullName)){\r\n            isLoading = false;\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        string tokenString = await authenticationtocken.GetTocken();\r\n        if(tokenState){\r\n            try{\r\n                var response = await fetchService.GetResponsSocialCard($\"{AppSettings.ApiBaseUrl}/get\", tokenString);\r\n                Dispatcher.Dispatch(new GetProfileCardState(response));\r\n                if(response != null){\r\n                    isLoading = false;\r\n                }else{\r\n                    throw new Exception(\"eroare\");\r\n                }\r\n            } catch (Exception) {\r\n                error = true;\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n        }else{\r\n            isLoading = false;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis setup ensures consistent management and updating of the profile information across the application using Fluxor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
