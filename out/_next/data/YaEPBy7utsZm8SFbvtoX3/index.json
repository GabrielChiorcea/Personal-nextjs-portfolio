It does not have a dedicated backend; instead, it relies on Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) for data storage and real-time functionality. Designed with a mobile-first approach, the application prioritizes optimization for mobile devices, providing core features inspired by Facebook, such as sharing posts and liking them.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"image columns-1 sm:columns-2 gap-8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n![Southpole 02.](/images/project/01.jpg)\r\n![Southpole 04.](/images/project/01-01.jpg)\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nFor data storage, the application uses a NoSQL Firebase database. User data, such as account creation information, is temporarily stored in the local session (e.g., localStorage or sessionStorage) and then sent to Firebase for permanent storage. Posts and other content-related data are retrieved from Firebase through API calls, often referred to as \"gates.\" These are then integrated into the app's state, which is managed using Redux, ensuring a consistent and efficient flow of information between components.\r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\nThe application incorporates modern technologies to achieve its functionality. While React serves as the framework for building the user interface, Sass is used for styling, offering modular and reusable designs. Redux is at the core of the app’s state management, enabling smooth synchronization of data such as posts, likes, and shares. Middleware like Redux Thunk facilitates handling asynchronous API calls to Firebase, ensuring organized and efficient state updates.\r\n\r\nThe user interactions within the app are intuitive and align with familiar patterns from social media platforms. For instance, users can share posts or like them, with these actions updating both the local state and Firebase in real-time. Account creation is straightforward, with user details initially stored locally before being validated and saved in Firebase. Posts and related interactions, once fetched, are synchronized with the Redux Store, making them readily accessible across various parts of the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redux Role in the Application \r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\nRedux manages the global state of the application, ensuring synchronization between Firebase and the user interface. Upon initialization, all posts are fetched from Firebase and stored in posts, an array that holds all existing posts.\r\n\r\nThe Redux state structure also includes oldPosts for older posts and newpost for newly created ones. When a user adds a new post, it's first stored in newpost, then added to both posts and jokes to keep the UI up-to-date. This allows real-time updates and ensures smooth content management across the application.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n name: 'post',\r\n  initialState: {\r\n    posts: [],\r\n    newPost: [],\r\n    topTen: [],\r\n    oldPost: [],\r\n    wellcomeState: 'empty',\r\n    writtenPost: false,\r\n    existUser: false,\r\n    cookieConsent: false,\r\n    deleteAccount: false,\r\n    error: {\r\n      errorMainArr: false,\r\n      errorMajorArr: false,\r\n      formError: false,\r\n      registration: false,\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Custom Hook for Post Updates (Like/Dislike)\r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\nIn this application, posts are categorized into two types: those containing obscene words and those that are normal. The like/dislike functionality relies on three key parameters: id, type, and url. The id uniquely identifies a post, type specifies whether it's a like or a dislike, and url determines which division the post belongs to (either containing obscene content or not). This url corresponds to different sections in the database, as the posts are stored separately to simplify analysis of the content.\r\n\r\nTo implement this functionality, a custom hook is designed to handle post updates based on user interaction. The process can be broken down as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Item 1 URL Fetching from env: Based on the provided url (indicating the division), the custom hook retrieves the corresponding URL stored in the environment file (.env). This URL points to the specific division of posts, allowing for clear separation of content that contains obscene words from normal content.\r\n\r\n2. Item 2 Like/Dislike Action: Once the hook receives the type (either \"like\" or \"dislike\"), it triggers an API call to the appropriate division (using the URL retrieved from env). The post’s unique id is used to fetch the relevant post data for processing.\r\n\r\n3. Item 3 Post Comparison and State Update: After fetching the post, the custom hook compares it to the corresponding entry in the oldPosts array (which holds previously fetched post data). If the post has changed—such as when the like/dislike count has been updated—the hook will update the Redux state with the new data. If the post differs from its previous state, it will be added to the posts array in Redux for UI reactivity.\r\n\r\n4. Item 4 Database Synchronization: Once the UI state is updated with the new like/dislike data, the hook ensures the changes are reflected in the Firebase database by sending an update request, ensuring consistency between the frontend and the backend.\r\n\r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { postActions } from '../store/post-slice';\r\nimport { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';\r\nconst useUpdate = () => {\r\n  const dispatch = useDispatch();\r\n\r\n  const mapPutVote = async (id, type, url) => {\r\n    const sendId = id;\r\n    const URL = url;\r\n\r\n    let response;\r\n    let comeFrom;\r\n    if (URL === process.env.REACT_APP_URL_POST) {\r\n      comeFrom = 'AllPosts';\r\n      response = await fetch(\r\n        process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixNormalDB + sendId + '.json'\r\n      );\r\n    } else {\r\n      comeFrom = 'MajorPosts';\r\n      response = await fetch(\r\n        process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixMajorDB + sendId + '.json'\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n    const data = await response.json();\r\n    let notIncremented = data.vote;\r\n    \r\n    let isIncrmented;\r\n\r\n    if (type === 'increment') {\r\n      isIncrmented = ++notIncremented;\r\n    } else if (type === 'decrease' && notIncremented <= 0) {\r\n      isIncrmented = notIncremented;\r\n    } else {\r\n      isIncrmented = --notIncremented;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const sendVote = { vote: isIncrmented };\r\n    const newVote = sendVote.vote;\r\n    const sendPayload = {\r\n      comeFrom: comeFrom,\r\n      id: sendId,\r\n      vote: sendVote.vote,\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    let switchedUrl;\r\n\r\n    if (URL === process.env.REACT_APP_URL_BANC) {\r\n      switchedUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixNormalDB + sendId + '.json';\r\n    } else if (URL === process.env.REACT_APP_URL_MAJOR) {\r\n      switchedUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixMajorDB + sendId + '.json';\r\n    }\r\n    if (notIncremented > 0) {\r\n      setTimeout(() => {\r\n        fetch(switchedUrl, {\r\n          method: 'PATCH',\r\n          body: JSON.stringify({ vote: newVote }),\r\n        });\r\n      }, 700);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    dispatch(postActions.upDateOldPosts(sendPayload));\r\n\r\n  };\r\n  return { mapPutVote };\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default useUpdate;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## More\r\n\r\n<div class=\"image columns-1 sm:columns-2 gap-8\">\r\n\r\n![Southpole 03.](/images/project/01-02.jpg)\r\n![Southpole 03.](/images/project/01-03.jpg)\r\n<!-- ![Southpole 03.](/images/project/01-03.jpg)\r\n![Southpole 04.](/images/project/01-04.jpg) -->\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"slug":"Store","frontMatter":{"date":"02-05-2023","title":"Store","description":"Branding","image":"/images/project/05.jpg","color":"#BE0000","category":"Product","projectInfo":[{"title":"Client","data":"Store"},{"title":"Timeline","data":"2 Months"},{"title":"Services","data":"- Branding\n- Website design\n- Marketing and Planning\n"},{"title":"Functions","data":"- Post Like\n- User Account\n- Activity track\n- Share post \n"}],"live":[{"link":"https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/"}]},"content":"\r\n## We couldn't be happier with the branding strategy developed.\r\n\r\nThroughout the process, Aver's collaborative approach and open communication ensured a seamless experience.

With the power of Docker, you can easily run Apache in an isolated container, making your setup portable and quick to deploy. In this blog post, we will walk you through the steps to install and run Apache on Ubuntu 22.04 using Docker. This setup is perfect for testing, development, or production environments.\n\n## What You'll Learn.\n\n\nIn this guide, you'll learn:\n\n1.  How to install Docker on Ubuntu 22.04.\n2.  How to pull and run Apache in a Docker container.\n3.  Basic management of your Apache Docker container.\n4.  How to troubleshoot any potential issues during the setup.\n\n## Step 1 Install Docker on Ubuntu 22.04\n\nBefore we begin setting up Apache, we need to ensure that Docker is installed on your system. Docker allows us to run Apache within a container, providing a lightweight and efficient environment. Follow these steps to get Docker up and running:\n\n1.1 Update Your System\n\nStart by updating your package lists to make sure you’re working with the latest versions of the software.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade -y\n```\n\n1.2 Install Required Dependencies\n\nNext, we’ll install some necessary dependencies to allow Docker to be added to the system.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common\n```\n\n1.3 Add Docker’s Official GPG Key\n\nNow, you need to add Docker’s official GPG key to your system so it can verify the Docker package authenticity.\n\n\n**curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg**\n\n1.4 Add Docker’s Repository\n\nAdd Docker’s official repository to your system’s list of sources, so you can install the latest version of Docker from it.\n\n\n**echo \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null**\n\n\n1.5 Install Docker\n\nNow you can install Docker. After updating your package list, install Docker using the following command:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io\n```\n\n1.6 Verify Docker Installation\n\nTo confirm Docker was installed successfully, check the version of Docker installed:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker --version\n```\n## Step 2 Run Apache in a Docker Container\n\nNow that Docker is installed, it's time to pull the official Apache image and run it in a container. Docker makes it incredibly easy to run a fully functional Apache web server without the need to configure anything manually.\n\n2.1 Pull the Official Apache Image\n\nDocker Hub has a ready-to-use official Apache image, so you don't have to create one from scratch. Pull the image by running:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker pull httpd\n```\n2.2 Run Apache in a Docker Container\n\nWith the Apache image pulled, we can now run it in a container. This will start Apache and bind it to your machine's port 8080:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name apache-server httpd\n```\n-d: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).\n-p 8080:80: Maps port 80 inside the container (the default Apache port) to port 8080 on your host machine.\n--name apache-server: Names your container \"apache-server\" for easy reference.\n\n2.3 Verify the Apache Container is Running\n\nTo check if your container is running properly, you can use:\n```bash\nsudo docker ps\n```\nThis command will list all running containers, and you should see your apache-server container in the list.\n\n2.4 Access Apache in Your Browser\n\nNow, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 or http://<your-server-ip>:8080 (if you're working on a remote machine). You should see the default Apache welcome page, which indicates that Apache is running inside the Docker container.\n\n## Step 3 Managing Your Apache Docker Container\n\nOnce your Apache server is running, you may need to perform some basic container management tasks. Here are some useful commands:\n\n3.1 Stop the Apache Container\n\nIf you need to stop the Apache container, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker stop apache-server\n```\n3.2 Start the Apache Container Again\n\nTo start the container again after stopping it:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker start apache-server\n```\n\n3.3 Remove the Apache Container\n\nIf you want to remove the container (for example, when cleaning up), use this command:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker rm apache-server\n```\n3.4 View Apache Logs\n\nTo view the logs generated by Apache inside the container:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker logs apache-server\n```\n\n## Step 4 Customize Your Apache Setup\n\nAt this point, you have Apache running in Docker with its default configuration. However, Docker allows for greater flexibility, enabling you to configure Apache further. You can mount configuration files or a custom website directory into your container, or even create a custom Dockerfile to suit your specific needs.\n\n4.1 Mounting Local Directories to Docker\n\nIf you want to serve your custom website, you can mount your local directory to the Apache container:\n```bash\nsudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v /path/to/your/website:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ --name apache-server httpd\n```\nThis command mounts the website directory on your host machine to the htdocs folder in the Apache container, where Apache looks for files to serve.\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\nDocker Image Pull Failures: Ensure you have a stable internet connection. If you encounter issues while pulling the Apache image, try running docker system prune to clear unused data and try again.\nPort Conflicts: If port 8080 is already in use, you can change the host port (e.g., -p 8081:80) when running the container.\nApache Errors: To check for any issues with Apache itself, use docker logs apache-server to view the container's log output.\n\n## Conclusion\nCongratulations! You’ve successfully set up Apache on Ubuntu 22.04 using Docker. This method is a clean and efficient way to run a web server, with the added benefits of Docker’s portability and ease of use. You can now scale your Apache setup, customize it, or even deploy it in production with minimal effort. Docker makes managing your server environments a breeze, and using Apache in a containerized environment is a powerful choice for modern web hosting.\n\nIf you want to take it a step further, you can integrate Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications or even link Apache with a MySQL or PHP container for dynamic website hosting.\n\nHappy coding, and enjoy your new Apache web server!"},{"slug":"Apache-on-Ubuntu-22.04-Using-DockerOLD","frontMatter":{"title":"The Role of a Developer in Creating Communities","description":"Sustainable communities are essential for the well-being of both people and the planet","image":"/images/blog/09.jpg","date":"2023-05-23","category":"post elements"},"content":"\r\n*Sustainable communities are essential for the well-being of both people and the planet. They are designed to minimize environmental impact, promote social equity, and enhance the overall quality of life. In creating such communities, architecture plays a crucial role.*\r\n\r\n\r\nArchitecture is not solely about creating aesthetically pleasing structures; it also has the power to shape our environment in a sustainable manner. From the design phase to construction and beyond, architects have the opportunity to incorporate sustainable principles that can significantly impact the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n> \"Good product come from good people, and all problems are solved by good design. Keep doing good design.\" \r\n> <cite>— Stephen Gardiner</cite>\r\n\r\nArchitects can employ various strategies to foster sustainability. First and foremost, they can prioritize energy efficiency by designing buildings that minimize energy consumption and incorporate renewable energy sources. This includes utilizing natural lighting, employing energy-efficient materials, and implementing efficient insulation systems.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, sustainable architecture promotes the use of eco-friendly materials, such as recycled and locally sourced materials, which reduces the carbon footprint associated with construction. By considering the life cycle of materials and designing for disassembly, architects can enable easier recycling and reuse in the future.\r\n\r\n## Navbar active State\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  const activeLink = navRef.current.querySelector(\".active\");\r\n  if (activeLink) {\r\n    activeLinkRef.current = activeLink;\r\n    setIndicatorPosition({\r\n      left: activeLink.offsetLeft,\r\n      width: activeLink.offsetWidth,\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n}, [mainMenu]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, architects can design spaces that encourage community engagement and social interaction. By incorporating public gathering areas, green spaces, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, they create opportunities for residents to connect, fostering a sense of community.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, sustainable communities are not merely a product of chance; they are a result of thoughtful and intentional architectural design. Architects have the power to shape our built environment in a way that promotes sustainability, energy efficiency, and community well-being. By embracing sustainable principles and incorporating them into their designs, architects contribute significantly to the creation of sustainable communities.\r\n\r\n# Markdown syntax guide\r\n\r\n## Headers\r\n\r\n# This is a Heading h1\r\n## This is a Heading h2 \r\n###### This is a Heading h6\r\n\r\n## Emphasis\r\n\r\n*This text will be italic*  \r\n_This will also be italic_\r\n\r\n**This text will be bold**  \r\n__This will also be bold__\r\n\r\n_You **can** combine them_\r\n\r\n## Lists\r\n\r\n### Unordered\r\n\r\n* Item 1\r\n* Item 2\r\n* Item 2a\r\n* Item 2b\r\n\r\n### Ordered\r\n\r\n1.
