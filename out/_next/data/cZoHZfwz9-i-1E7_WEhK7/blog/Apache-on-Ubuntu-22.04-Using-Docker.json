With the power of Docker, you can easily run Apache in an isolated container, making your setup portable and quick to deploy. In this blog post, we will walk you through the steps to install and run Apache on Ubuntu 22.04 using Docker. This setup is perfect for testing, development, or production environments.\n\n## What You'll Learn.\n\n\nIn this guide, you'll learn:\n\n1.  How to install Docker on Ubuntu 22.04.\n2.  How to pull and run Apache in a Docker container.\n3.  Basic management of your Apache Docker container.\n4.  How to troubleshoot any potential issues during the setup.\n\n## Step 1 Install Docker on Ubuntu 22.04\n\nBefore we begin setting up Apache, we need to ensure that Docker is installed on your system. Docker allows us to run Apache within a container, providing a lightweight and efficient environment. Follow these steps to get Docker up and running:\n\n1.1 Update Your System\n\nStart by updating your package lists to make sure you’re working with the latest versions of the software.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade -y\n```\n\n1.2 Install Required Dependencies\n\nNext, we’ll install some necessary dependencies to allow Docker to be added to the system.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common\n```\n\n1.3 Add Docker’s Official GPG Key\n\nNow, you need to add Docker’s official GPG key to your system so it can verify the Docker package authenticity.\n\n\n**curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg**\n\n1.4 Add Docker’s Repository\n\nAdd Docker’s official repository to your system’s list of sources, so you can install the latest version of Docker from it.\n\n\n**echo \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null**\n\n\n1.5 Install Docker\n\nNow you can install Docker. After updating your package list, install Docker using the following command:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io\n```\n\n1.6 Verify Docker Installation\n\nTo confirm Docker was installed successfully, check the version of Docker installed:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker --version\n```\n## Step 2 Run Apache in a Docker Container\n\nNow that Docker is installed, it's time to pull the official Apache image and run it in a container. Docker makes it incredibly easy to run a fully functional Apache web server without the need to configure anything manually.\n\n2.1 Pull the Official Apache Image\n\nDocker Hub has a ready-to-use official Apache image, so you don't have to create one from scratch. Pull the image by running:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker pull httpd\n```\n2.2 Run Apache in a Docker Container\n\nWith the Apache image pulled, we can now run it in a container. This will start Apache and bind it to your machine's port 8080:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name apache-server httpd\n```\n-d: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).\n-p 8080:80: Maps port 80 inside the container (the default Apache port) to port 8080 on your host machine.\n--name apache-server: Names your container \"apache-server\" for easy reference.\n\n2.3 Verify the Apache Container is Running\n\nTo check if your container is running properly, you can use:\n```bash\nsudo docker ps\n```\nThis command will list all running containers, and you should see your apache-server container in the list.\n\n2.4 Access Apache in Your Browser\n\nNow, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 or http://<your-server-ip>:8080 (if you're working on a remote machine). You should see the default Apache welcome page, which indicates that Apache is running inside the Docker container.\n\n## Step 3 Managing Your Apache Docker Container\n\nOnce your Apache server is running, you may need to perform some basic container management tasks. Here are some useful commands:\n\n3.1 Stop the Apache Container\n\nIf you need to stop the Apache container, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker stop apache-server\n```\n3.2 Start the Apache Container Again\n\nTo start the container again after stopping it:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker start apache-server\n```\n\n3.3 Remove the Apache Container\n\nIf you want to remove the container (for example, when cleaning up), use this command:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker rm apache-server\n```\n3.4 View Apache Logs\n\nTo view the logs generated by Apache inside the container:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker logs apache-server\n```\n\n## Step 4 Customize Your Apache Setup\n\nAt this point, you have Apache running in Docker with its default configuration. However, Docker allows for greater flexibility, enabling you to configure Apache further. You can mount configuration files or a custom website directory into your container, or even create a custom Dockerfile to suit your specific needs.\n\n4.1 Mounting Local Directories to Docker\n\nIf you want to serve your custom website, you can mount your local directory to the Apache container:\n```bash\nsudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v /path/to/your/website:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ --name apache-server httpd\n```\nThis command mounts the website directory on your host machine to the htdocs folder in the Apache container, where Apache looks for files to serve.\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\nDocker Image Pull Failures: Ensure you have a stable internet connection. If you encounter issues while pulling the Apache image, try running docker system prune to clear unused data and try again.\nPort Conflicts: If port 8080 is already in use, you can change the host port (e.g., -p 8081:80) when running the container.\nApache Errors: To check for any issues with Apache itself, use docker logs apache-server to view the container's log output.\n\n## Conclusion\nCongratulations! You’ve successfully set up Apache on Ubuntu 22.04 using Docker. This method is a clean and efficient way to run a web server, with the added benefits of Docker’s portability and ease of use. You can now scale your Apache setup, customize it, or even deploy it in production with minimal effort. Docker makes managing your server environments a breeze, and using Apache in a containerized environment is a powerful choice for modern web hosting.\n\nIf you want to take it a step further, you can integrate Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications or even link Apache with a MySQL or PHP container for dynamic website hosting.\n\nHappy coding, and enjoy your new Apache web server!"},"previousPost":{"slug":"server-side-vs-client-side","frontMatter":{"title":"Server-Side vs. Client-Side Rendering: Which One to Choose in 2025?","description":"It’s 2025, and the web dev world just keeps moving faster than my morning coffee routine in SoCal. If you’re here, you’re probably wondering whether Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Client-Side Rendering (CSR) is the right pick for your next big project. Spoiler alert: there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but don’t worry—I’ve got you covered. Let’s break it all down in simple terms and help you make the call!","image":"/images/blog/ssrvscsr.jpg","date":"2024-12-31","category":"Server"},"content":"\n\nHey there, tech fan! 👋\n\n## What’s the Deal with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?\n\nAlright, here’s the lowdown: SSR means your server does the heavy lifting. When someone visits your site, the server sends them a fully-formed, ready-to-go HTML page.\n\nWhy SSR is Still Cool in 2025 ?\n1. Fast Initial Loads: Your users see the content right away. No waiting around for JavaScript to do its thing. Perfect for folks on slow connections (looking at you, spotty coffee shop Wi-Fi).\n2. SEO Heaven: If you’re building something like a blog, news site, or an online store, SSR makes sure Google can actually see your content. More visibility = more traffic = more mony.\n3. Universal Access: Got users with older browsers or limited JS support? SSR’s got their back.\n\nWhat’s the Catch?\n   - Your server’s gonna feel the heat. Every request means work, so scalability can be tricky.\n   - Dynamic stuff (like those fancy widgets you love) needs extra JavaScript to stay interactive.\n\n## What About Client-Side Rendering (CSR)?\n\nNow, CSR flips the script. The server hands your browser some basic HTML and JavaScript, and the browser takes over, building the page right in front of the user’s eyes.\n\nWhy CSR is the Life of the Party\n1. Smooth & Interactive: CSR shines when you’ve got a lot of dynamic, clicky stuff going on—think admin dashboards or real-time chat apps.\n2. Server-Friendly: Your server can chill while the browser does most of the work. Good for apps with tons of users.\n3. App-Like Vibes: Fast transitions, no page reloads—it feels like a native app.\n\nThe Downsides?\n1. That initial load can feel sloooow. Users on weaker connections might see a blank page before everything kicks in.\n2. Search engines aren’t always thrilled with JavaScript-heavy sites, so you’ll need extra tools to keep them happy.\n\n## Why Not Both? (Hint: You Totally Can)\n\nHere’s the good news: in 2025, you don’t have to pick a side. Hybrid solutions are where it’s at, thanks to frameworks like Next.js, Blazor, and SvelteKit. Let me drop some buzzwords for you:\n\nStatic Site Generation (SSG)\n\nYour pages are pre-built and served super-fast. Great for stuff that doesn’t change every five seconds, like portfolio sites or blogs.\n\nIncremental Static Regeneration (ISR)\n\nImagine getting all the benefits of static pages, but with the ability to update them dynamically as needed. This one’s perfect for online stores or any site with frequently updated content.\n\nPartial Hydration\n\nOnly load JavaScript for the interactive parts of the page. The rest stays snappy and server-rendered. Modern magic, am I right?\n\n## So… How Do You Choose?\n\nHere’s the cheat sheet:\n\nGo SSR if you need:\nLightning-fast initial page loads.\n\nTop-notch SEO for your content.\n\nA global audience with mixed tech setups.\n\nGo CSR if you need:\n\nA super interactive, app-like feel.\n\nReal-time data updates (think dashboards).\n\nTo scale for lots of users without overloading your servers.\n\nGo Hybrid if you want the best of both worlds. Seriously, it’s 2025—why compromise?\n\n## Real-Life Examples\n\nHere’s how I’d play it:\n\nSSR for Blogs and News Sites: Imagine dropping a new blog post about the best coffee spots in California. You want that to load fast and rank high on Google. SSR’s your bestie here.\n\nCSR for Dashboards: Building a project management app for your startup? CSR’s smooth interactivity is exactly what you need.\nHybrid for E-Commerce: Got a shop selling handcrafted surfboards? Use SSR for product pages (SEO gold!) and CSR for that interactive shopping cart.\n\n\n## Wrap-Up: SSR vs. CSR—Who Wins?\n\nThe real winner? Your users. Picking the right approach depends on what you’re building and who you’re building it for. The cool thing is, frameworks in 2025 make it easier than ever to mix and match.\n\nStill on the fence? Hit me up in the comments, or check out tools like Next.js, Blazor, or Astro—they’re game changers.\n\nAlright, that’s it for today! Now go out there and build something amazing. And hey, if you’re in California, let’s grab a coffee and talk tech. ☕\n"},"nextPost":{"slug":"cerbot","frontMatter":{"title":"How to Install and Use Let's Encrypt SSL on Your Server (Apache & Nginx)","description":"Certbot is the recommended client for obtaining and renewing SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt. The installation process depends on your Linux distribution (or operating system), but the following steps are for Ubuntu. The process is similar for other distributions.","image":"/images/blog/cerbot.jpg","date":"2024-12-20","category":"Server"},"content":"\nLet’s Encrypt uses Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol to automate the process of obtaining and installing SSL certificates. The most common ACME client is Certbot, which is responsible for obtaining the certificates from Let’s Encrypt and configuring the server.\n\nLet’s Encrypt certificates are domain-validated certificates, meaning they only verify the ownership of the domain and not the identity of the organization behind it. This is why they are ideal for personal blogs, small businesses, or any website that doesn’t require extended validation (EV) certificates.\n\n## Install Certbot\n## On Ubuntu/Debian.\nUpdate existing packages:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\n```\n## Install Certbot and the plugin for Nginx or Apache (depending on your web server):\n\nFor Nginx:\n```bash\nsudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx\n```\n\nFor Apache:\n```bash\nsudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache\n```\n\n## On CentOS/RHEL.\nInstall EPEL repository (for CentOS 7 and below):\n\n```bash\nsudo yum install epel-release\n```\n\n\nInstall Certbot:\n\n```bash\nsudo yum install certbot python2-certbot-nginx\n```\n## Obtain the SSL Certificate\nAfter installation, you can obtain an SSL certificate for your domain. Certbot will automatically check if your domain is configured correctly and request the certificate from Let's Encrypt.\n\nFor Nginx:\n```bash\nsudo certbot --nginx\n```\n\nFor Apache:\n```bash\nsudo certbot --apache\n```\nCertbot will ask you to enter your email address and accept the terms and conditions. It will then automatically verify your domain and configure the web server to use the SSL certificate.\n\nSet Up Automatic Certificate Renewal\nLet's Encrypt certificates are valid for only 90 days. It’s important to set up automatic renewal.\n\nCertbot includes a cron job to handle automatic renewals, but you can check it by running:\n\n```bash\nsudo certbot renew --dry-run\n```\nThis simulates the renewal process and will show you if everything is working fine.\n\n## Check the Installation\nOnce you've configured Let's Encrypt, you can check that SSL is working by accessing your site using https:// in front of your domain. You can also verify with an online tool like SSL Labs.\n\nConfigure HTTP to HTTPS Redirection\nTo ensure that all visitors to your site are using HTTPS, you should redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. If you used the Certbot plugin for Nginx or Apache, it will automatically configure this redirection.\n\n\n1. For Nginx:\n\nExample of SSL Configuration in Nginx (yourdomain.com.conf):\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;\n    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n}\n\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl;\n    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;\n\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;\n\n    location / {\n        root /var/www/yourdomain;\n        index index.html index.php; #etc\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nIn the server block configuration (usually /etc/nginx/sites-available/default), add a section for HTTP to HTTPS redirection:\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;\n    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n}\n```\n\n2. For Apache:\n\nIn your Apache configuration file (located in /etc/apache2/sites-available/), ensure there’s a VirtualHost block for HTTPS (port 443) and an HTTP to HTTPS redirection block.\n\nExample of SSL Configuration in Apache (default-ssl.conf):\n\n```bash\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@yourdomain.com\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/yourdomain\n    ServerName yourdomain.com\n    ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com\n\n    SSLEngine on\n    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem\n    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem\n    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/chain.pem\n\n    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\n    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n\n    # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS\n    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\n        RewriteEngine On\n        RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off\n        RewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]\n    </IfModule>\n</VirtualHost>\n\n```\n\nThen enable SSL and the default-ssl site configuration:\n\n```bash\nsudo a2enmod ssl\nsudo a2ensite default-ssl\nsudo systemctl restart apache2\n\n```\nAdd this rule in your .htaccess file or Apache configuration:\n\n```bash\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} off\nRewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]\n```\n\n\nPeriodically Check Certificates\nSetting up and using Let's Encrypt SSL certificates is a straightforward process with Certbot, ensuring that your website traffic is encrypted and secure. Whether you're using Apache or Nginx, this guide provides the necessary steps to configure SSL and redirect HTTP to HTTPS.\n\nBy regularly checking your SSL certificates and ensuring automatic renewals, you can maintain a secure and trusted website for your visitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
