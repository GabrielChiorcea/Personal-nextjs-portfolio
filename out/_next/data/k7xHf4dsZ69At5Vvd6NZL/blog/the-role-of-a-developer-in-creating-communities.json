This includes utilizing natural lighting, employing energy-efficient materials, and implementing efficient insulation systems.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, sustainable architecture promotes the use of eco-friendly materials, such as recycled and locally sourced materials, which reduces the carbon footprint associated with construction.
