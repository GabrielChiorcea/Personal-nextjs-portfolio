It does not have a dedicated backend; instead, it relies on Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) for data storage and real-time functionality. Designed with a mobile-first approach, the application prioritizes optimization for mobile devices, providing core features inspired by Facebook, such as sharing posts and liking them.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"image columns-1 sm:columns-2 gap-8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n![Southpole 02.](/images/project/01.jpg)\r\n![Southpole 04.](/images/project/01-01.jpg)\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nFor data storage, the application uses a NoSQL Firebase database. User data, such as account creation information, is temporarily stored in the local session (e.g., localStorage or sessionStorage) and then sent to Firebase for permanent storage. Posts and other content-related data are retrieved from Firebase through API calls, often referred to as \"gates.\" These are then integrated into the app's state, which is managed using Redux, ensuring a consistent and efficient flow of information between components.\r\n\r\nThe application incorporates modern technologies to achieve its functionality. While React serves as the framework for building the user interface, Sass is used for styling, offering modular and reusable designs. Redux is at the core of the app’s state management, enabling smooth synchronization of data such as posts, likes, and shares. Middleware like Redux Thunk facilitates handling asynchronous API calls to Firebase, ensuring organized and efficient state updates.\r\n\r\nThe user interactions within the app are intuitive and align with familiar patterns from social media platforms. For instance, users can share posts or like them, with these actions updating both the local state and Firebase in real-time. Account creation is straightforward, with user details initially stored locally before being validated and saved in Firebase. Posts and related interactions, once fetched, are synchronized with the Redux Store, making them readily accessible across various parts of the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redux Role in the Application\r\nRedux manages the global state of the application, ensuring synchronization between Firebase and the user interface. Upon initialization, all posts are fetched from Firebase and stored in posts, an array that holds all existing posts.\r\n\r\nThe Redux state structure also includes oldPosts for older posts and newpost for newly created ones. When a user adds a new post, it's first stored in newpost, then added to both posts and jokes to keep the UI up-to-date. This allows real-time updates and ensures smooth content management across the application.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n name: 'post',\r\n  initialState: {\r\n    posts: [],\r\n    newPost: [],\r\n    topTen: [],\r\n    oldPost: [],\r\n    wellcomeState: 'empty',\r\n    writtenPost: false,\r\n    existUser: false,\r\n    cookieConsent: false,\r\n    deleteAccount: false,\r\n    error: {\r\n      errorMainArr: false,\r\n      errorMajorArr: false,\r\n      formError: false,\r\n      registration: false,\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Custom Hook for Post Updates (Like/Dislike)\r\n\r\nIn this application, posts are categorized into two types: those containing obscene words and those that are normal. The like/dislike functionality relies on three key parameters: id, type, and url. The id uniquely identifies a post, type specifies whether it's a like or a dislike, and url determines which division the post belongs to (either containing obscene content or not). This url corresponds to different sections in the database, as the posts are stored separately to simplify analysis of the content.\r\n\r\nTo implement this functionality, a custom hook is designed to handle post updates based on user interaction. The process can be broken down as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Item 1 URL Fetching from env: Based on the provided url (indicating the division), the custom hook retrieves the corresponding URL stored in the environment file (.env). This URL points to the specific division of posts, allowing for clear separation of content that contains obscene words from normal content.\r\n\r\n2. Item 2 Like/Dislike Action: Once the hook receives the type (either \"like\" or \"dislike\"), it triggers an API call to the appropriate division (using the URL retrieved from env). The post’s unique id is used to fetch the relevant post data for processing.\r\n\r\n3. Item 3 Post Comparison and State Update: After fetching the post, the custom hook compares it to the corresponding entry in the oldPosts array (which holds previously fetched post data). If the post has changed—such as when the like/dislike count has been updated—the hook will update the Redux state with the new data. If the post differs from its previous state, it will be added to the posts array in Redux for UI reactivity.\r\n\r\n4. Item 4 Database Synchronization: Once the UI state is updated with the new like/dislike data, the hook ensures the changes are reflected in the Firebase database by sending an update request, ensuring consistency between the frontend and the backend.\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { postActions } from '../store/post-slice';\r\nimport { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';\r\nconst useUpdate = () => {\r\n  const dispatch = useDispatch();\r\n\r\n  const mapPutVote = async (id, type, url) => {\r\n    const sendId = id;\r\n    const URL = url;\r\n\r\n    let response;\r\n    let comeFrom;\r\n    if (URL === process.env.REACT_APP_URL_POST) {\r\n      comeFrom = 'AllPosts';\r\n      response = await fetch(\r\n        process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixNormalDB + sendId + '.json'\r\n      );\r\n    } else {\r\n      comeFrom = 'MajorPosts';\r\n      response = await fetch(\r\n        process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixMajorDB + sendId + '.json'\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n    const data = await response.json();\r\n    let notIncremented = data.vote;\r\n    \r\n    let isIncrmented;\r\n\r\n    if (type === 'increment') {\r\n      isIncrmented = ++notIncremented;\r\n    } else if (type === 'decrease' && notIncremented <= 0) {\r\n      isIncrmented = notIncremented;\r\n    } else {\r\n      isIncrmented = --notIncremented;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const sendVote = { vote: isIncrmented };\r\n    const newVote = sendVote.vote;\r\n    const sendPayload = {\r\n      comeFrom: comeFrom,\r\n      id: sendId,\r\n      vote: sendVote.vote,\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    let switchedUrl;\r\n\r\n    if (URL === process.env.REACT_APP_URL_BANC) {\r\n      switchedUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixNormalDB + sendId + '.json';\r\n    } else if (URL === process.env.REACT_APP_URL_MAJOR) {\r\n      switchedUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixMajorDB + sendId + '.json';\r\n    }\r\n    if (notIncremented > 0) {\r\n      setTimeout(() => {\r\n        fetch(switchedUrl, {\r\n          method: 'PATCH',\r\n          body: JSON.stringify({ vote: newVote }),\r\n        });\r\n      }, 700);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    dispatch(postActions.upDateOldPosts(sendPayload));\r\n\r\n  };\r\n  return { mapPutVote };\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default useUpdate;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## More\r\n\r\n<div class=\"image columns-1 sm:columns-2 gap-8\">\r\n\r\n![Southpole 03.](/images/project/01-02.jpg)\r\n![Southpole 03.](/images/project/01-03.jpg)\r\n<!-- ![Southpole 03.](/images/project/01-03.jpg)\r\n![Southpole 04.](/images/project/01-04.jpg) -->\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"slug":"Store","frontMatter":{"date":"02-05-2023","title":"Store","description":"Branding","image":"/images/project/05.jpg","color":"#BE0000","category":"Product","projectInfo":[{"title":"Client","data":"Store"},{"title":"Timeline","data":"2 Months"},{"title":"Services","data":"- Branding\n- Website design\n- Marketing and Planning\n"}],"live":[{"link":"https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/"}]},"content":"\r\n## We couldn't be happier with the branding strategy developed.\r\n\r\nThroughout the process, Aver's collaborative approach and open communication ensured a seamless experience.

They are designed to minimize environmental impact, promote social equity, and enhance the overall quality of life. In creating such communities, architecture plays a crucial role.*\r\n\r\n\r\nArchitecture is not solely about creating aesthetically pleasing structures; it also has the power to shape our environment in a sustainable manner. From the design phase to construction and beyond, architects have the opportunity to incorporate sustainable principles that can significantly impact the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n> \"Good product come from good people, and all problems are solved by good design. Keep doing good design.\" \r\n> <cite>— Stephen Gardiner</cite>\r\n\r\nArchitects can employ various strategies to foster sustainability. First and foremost, they can prioritize energy efficiency by designing buildings that minimize energy consumption and incorporate renewable energy sources. This includes utilizing natural lighting, employing energy-efficient materials, and implementing efficient insulation systems.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, sustainable architecture promotes the use of eco-friendly materials, such as recycled and locally sourced materials, which reduces the carbon footprint associated with construction. By considering the life cycle of materials and designing for disassembly, architects can enable easier recycling and reuse in the future.\r\n\r\n## Navbar active State\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  const activeLink = navRef.current.querySelector(\".active\");\r\n  if (activeLink) {\r\n    activeLinkRef.current = activeLink;\r\n    setIndicatorPosition({\r\n      left: activeLink.offsetLeft,\r\n      width: activeLink.offsetWidth,\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n}, [mainMenu]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, architects can design spaces that encourage community engagement and social interaction. By incorporating public gathering areas, green spaces, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, they create opportunities for residents to connect, fostering a sense of community.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, sustainable communities are not merely a product of chance; they are a result of thoughtful and intentional architectural design. Architects have the power to shape our built environment in a way that promotes sustainability, energy efficiency, and community well-being. By embracing sustainable principles and incorporating them into their designs, architects contribute significantly to the creation of sustainable communities.\r\n\r\n# Markdown syntax guide\r\n\r\n## Headers\r\n\r\n# This is a Heading h1\r\n## This is a Heading h2 \r\n###### This is a Heading h6\r\n\r\n## Emphasis\r\n\r\n*This text will be italic*  \r\n_This will also be italic_\r\n\r\n**This text will be bold**  \r\n__This will also be bold__\r\n\r\n_You **can** combine them_\r\n\r\n## Lists\r\n\r\n### Unordered\r\n\r\n* Item 1\r\n* Item 2\r\n* Item 2a\r\n* Item 2b\r\n\r\n### Ordered\r\n\r\n1.
