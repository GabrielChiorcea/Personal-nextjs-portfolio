It does not have a dedicated backend; instead, it relies on Firebase as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) for data storage and real-time functionality. Designed with a mobile-first approach, the application prioritizes optimization for mobile devices, providing core features inspired by Facebook, such as sharing posts and liking them.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"image columns-1 sm:columns-2 gap-8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n![Southpole 02.](/images/project/01.jpg)\r\n![Southpole 04.](/images/project/01-01.jpg)\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nFor data storage, the application uses a NoSQL Firebase database. User data, such as account creation information, is temporarily stored in the local session (e.g., localStorage or sessionStorage) and then sent to Firebase for permanent storage. Posts and other content-related data are retrieved from Firebase through API calls, often referred to as \"gates.\" These are then integrated into the app's state, which is managed using Redux, ensuring a consistent and efficient flow of information between components.\r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\nThe application incorporates modern technologies to achieve its functionality. While React serves as the framework for building the user interface, Sass is used for styling, offering modular and reusable designs. Redux is at the core of the app’s state management, enabling smooth synchronization of data such as posts, likes, and shares. Middleware like Redux Thunk facilitates handling asynchronous API calls to Firebase, ensuring organized and efficient state updates.\r\n\r\nThe user interactions within the app are intuitive and align with familiar patterns from social media platforms. For instance, users can share posts or like them, with these actions updating both the local state and Firebase in real-time. Account creation is straightforward, with user details initially stored locally before being validated and saved in Firebase. Posts and related interactions, once fetched, are synchronized with the Redux Store, making them readily accessible across various parts of the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Redux Role in the Application \r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\nRedux manages the global state of the application, ensuring synchronization between Firebase and the user interface. Upon initialization, all posts are fetched from Firebase and stored in posts, an array that holds all existing posts.\r\n\r\nThe Redux state structure also includes oldPosts for older posts and newpost for newly created ones. When a user adds a new post, it's first stored in newpost, then added to both posts and jokes to keep the UI up-to-date. This allows real-time updates and ensures smooth content management across the application.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n name: 'post',\r\n  initialState: {\r\n    posts: [],\r\n    newPost: [],\r\n    topTen: [],\r\n    oldPost: [],\r\n    wellcomeState: 'empty',\r\n    writtenPost: false,\r\n    existUser: false,\r\n    cookieConsent: false,\r\n    deleteAccount: false,\r\n    error: {\r\n      errorMainArr: false,\r\n      errorMajorArr: false,\r\n      formError: false,\r\n      registration: false,\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Custom Hook for Post Updates (Like/Dislike)\r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\nIn this application, posts are categorized into two types: those containing obscene words and those that are normal. The like/dislike functionality relies on three key parameters: id, type, and url. The id uniquely identifies a post, type specifies whether it's a like or a dislike, and url determines which division the post belongs to (either containing obscene content or not). This url corresponds to different sections in the database, as the posts are stored separately to simplify analysis of the content.\r\n\r\nTo implement this functionality, a custom hook is designed to handle post updates based on user interaction. The process can be broken down as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Item 1 URL Fetching from env: Based on the provided url (indicating the division), the custom hook retrieves the corresponding URL stored in the environment file (.env). This URL points to the specific division of posts, allowing for clear separation of content that contains obscene words from normal content.\r\n\r\n2. Item 2 Like/Dislike Action: Once the hook receives the type (either \"like\" or \"dislike\"), it triggers an API call to the appropriate division (using the URL retrieved from env). The post’s unique id is used to fetch the relevant post data for processing.\r\n\r\n3. Item 3 Post Comparison and State Update: After fetching the post, the custom hook compares it to the corresponding entry in the oldPosts array (which holds previously fetched post data). If the post has changed—such as when the like/dislike count has been updated—the hook will update the Redux state with the new data. If the post differs from its previous state, it will be added to the posts array in Redux for UI reactivity.\r\n\r\n4. Item 4 Database Synchronization: Once the UI state is updated with the new like/dislike data, the hook ensures the changes are reflected in the Firebase database by sending an update request, ensuring consistency between the frontend and the backend.\r\n\r\n[Acces live](https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/).\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { postActions } from '../store/post-slice';\r\nimport { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';\r\nconst useUpdate = () => {\r\n  const dispatch = useDispatch();\r\n\r\n  const mapPutVote = async (id, type, url) => {\r\n    const sendId = id;\r\n    const URL = url;\r\n\r\n    let response;\r\n    let comeFrom;\r\n    if (URL === process.env.REACT_APP_URL_POST) {\r\n      comeFrom = 'AllPosts';\r\n      response = await fetch(\r\n        process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixNormalDB + sendId + '.json'\r\n      );\r\n    } else {\r\n      comeFrom = 'MajorPosts';\r\n      response = await fetch(\r\n        process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixMajorDB + sendId + '.json'\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n    const data = await response.json();\r\n    let notIncremented = data.vote;\r\n    \r\n    let isIncrmented;\r\n\r\n    if (type === 'increment') {\r\n      isIncrmented = ++notIncremented;\r\n    } else if (type === 'decrease' && notIncremented <= 0) {\r\n      isIncrmented = notIncremented;\r\n    } else {\r\n      isIncrmented = --notIncremented;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const sendVote = { vote: isIncrmented };\r\n    const newVote = sendVote.vote;\r\n    const sendPayload = {\r\n      comeFrom: comeFrom,\r\n      id: sendId,\r\n      vote: sendVote.vote,\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    let switchedUrl;\r\n\r\n    if (URL === process.env.REACT_APP_URL_BANC) {\r\n      switchedUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixNormalDB + sendId + '.json';\r\n    } else if (URL === process.env.REACT_APP_URL_MAJOR) {\r\n      switchedUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_PrefixMajorDB + sendId + '.json';\r\n    }\r\n    if (notIncremented > 0) {\r\n      setTimeout(() => {\r\n        fetch(switchedUrl, {\r\n          method: 'PATCH',\r\n          body: JSON.stringify({ vote: newVote }),\r\n        });\r\n      }, 700);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    dispatch(postActions.upDateOldPosts(sendPayload));\r\n\r\n  };\r\n  return { mapPutVote };\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default useUpdate;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## More\r\n\r\n<div class=\"image columns-1 sm:columns-2 gap-8\">\r\n\r\n![Southpole 03.](/images/project/01-02.jpg)\r\n![Southpole 03.](/images/project/01-03.jpg)\r\n<!-- ![Southpole 03.](/images/project/01-03.jpg)\r\n![Southpole 04.](/images/project/01-04.jpg) -->\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n"},"nextProject":{"slug":"Store","frontMatter":{"date":"02-05-2023","title":"Store","lang":"Build with Python","description":"Excel reading data","image":"/images/project/05.jpg","color":"#BE0000","category":"WebApp","projectInfo":[{"title":"Client","data":"World wide"},{"title":"Release date","data":"07-06-2024"},{"title":"Tehnology","data":"- Python\n- Rest API\n- Panda\n"},{"title":"Functions","data":"- Excel to JSON \n- User account\n- Custome API\n- Chart creation \n"}],"live":[{"link":"https://quote.gabrielchiorcea.tech/"}]},"content":"\r\n## Arhitecture.\r\n\r\nThis application serves as a backend capable of processing and reading data from Excel files. To utilize this backend and connect it to a frontend, a user account is required. The account is essential as it provides a unique API key for authentication and authorization.\r\n\r\nExcel files are read using Pandas, which converts the file content into a DataFrame. Once transformed into a DataFrame, the data is further converted into JSON format based on the specific functions or filters requested. This enables dynamic and customizable data extraction from the Excel file.\r\n\r\nThe Excel file itself is stored in the database as a binary large object (BLOB), ensuring secure and efficient storage\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"image columns-1 sm:columns-2 gap-8\">\r\n\r\n![CocaCola 01.](/images/project/05-01.jpg)\r\n![CocaCola 02.](/images/project/05-02.jpg)\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Get and store the excel file\r\n\r\nThe Excel file is uploaded via the /excel endpoint of the API. At this endpoint, the file undergoes validation to ensure it is an Excel file, even if the frontend does not perform this check. Once validated, the file is renamed for consistency and security.\r\n\r\nThe renaming process involves appending a unique ID, derived from the user’s API key, to the file name. The resulting format is {ID}.xlsx. The renamed file is then securely stored in the database as a BLOB with its new identifier, ensuring traceability and efficient management.\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@app.route('/excel', methods=['POST'])\r\n@csrf.exempt\r\ndef upload_excel():\r\n    try:\r\n        # Check if a file is present in the request\r\n        if 'file' not in request.files:\r\n            return jsonify({'res': 'No file found in the request'}), 400\r\n        \r\n        file_in = request.files['file']\r\n        id = request.args.get('id')\r\n\r\n        # Validate the user ID parameter\r\n        if not id:\r\n            return jsonify({'res': 'Missing user ID'}), 400\r\n\r\n        # Check if the file name is empty\r\n        if file_in.filename == '':\r\n            return jsonify({'res': 'File name is empty'}), 400\r\n\r\n        # Validate the file extension (only .xlsx and .xls are allowed)\r\n        if not (file_in.filename.endswith('.xlsx') or file_in.filename.endswith('.xls')):\r\n            return jsonify({'res': 'Invalid file type, only Excel files are allowed (.xlsx, .xls)'}), 400\r\n\r\n        file_content = file_in.read()\r\n        \r\n        # Ensure the file is not empty\r\n        if not file_content:\r\n            return jsonify({'res': 'Uploaded file is empty'}), 400\r\n\r\n        # Generate a unique name for the file based on the user ID\r\n        file_name = f\"{id}.xlsx\"\r\n\r\n        # Create a new database record for the Excel file\r\n        new_excel_file = Excel(name=file_name, excel=file_content)\r\n\r\n        # Add the file to the database session and commit\r\n        db.session.add(new_excel_file)\r\n        db.session.commit()\r\n\r\n        return jsonify({'res': 'File uploaded successfully'}), 200\r\n\r\n    except Exception as e:\r\n        # Roll back the database transaction in case of an error\r\n        db.session.rollback()\r\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")  # Log the error details to the console\r\n        return jsonify({'res': f'An error occurred while processing the file: {str(e)}'}), 500\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How the backend know what data to give you\r\n\r\nThe below API endpoint, accessible via /<string:para>/<string:ident> with a GET request, dynamically processes Excel files stored in a database. It retrieves the file based on an id query parameter, reads it into a Pandas DataFrame, and executes specific functions depending on the para value (e.g., counting null values, extracting data, summarizing content, filling missing values, or generating charts). The user's existence and identification (ident) are validated against the database, and if necessary, new identification records are created.
