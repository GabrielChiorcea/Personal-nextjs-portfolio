One powerful way to boost performance is by using **memoization** â€” a technique that caches the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.\n\n  \n\nIn this post, Iâ€™ll walk you through how to use memoization effectively in React, focusing on the built-in hooks and components that help you avoid unnecessary re-renders.\n\n  \n\n---\n\n  \n\n## What is Memoization?\n\n  \n\nMemoization is an optimization technique that stores (\"memoizes\") the result of a function call based on its inputs. If the function is called again with the same inputs, the cached result is returned instead of recomputing.\n\n  \n\nIn React, this helps prevent unnecessary rendering and computation, which can improve app responsiveness and reduce CPU usage.\n\n  \n\n---\n\n  \n\n## React Memoization Tools\n\n  \n\nReact provides several tools to help with memoization:\n\n  \n\n- `React.memo` â€” memoizes functional components, preventing re-render if props donâ€™t change.\n\n- `useMemo` â€” memoizes the result of a calculation between renders.\n\n- `useCallback` â€” memoizes a callback function reference, preventing unnecessary re-creations.\n\n  \n\n---\n\n  \n\n## When to Use `React.memo`\n\n  \n\nUse `React.memo` to wrap functional components that receive props and only need to re-render when those props change.\n\n  \n\n```jsx\n\nimport React from  'react';\n\n  \n\nconst  ExpensiveComponent  = React.memo(({ data }) =\u003e {\n\nconsole.log('Rendering ExpensiveComponent');\n\n// expensive calculations or rendering here\n\nreturn \u003cdiv\u003e{data}\u003c/div\u003e;\n\n});\n```\n\n## Using useMemo for Expensive Calculations\n\nIf you have heavy computations inside your component, use useMemo to cache the results:\n\n  \n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useMemo } from  'react';\n\n  \n\nfunction  Fibonacci({ n }) {\n\n// useMemo will recompute the value only when `n` changes\n\nconst  fib  =  useMemo(() =\u003e {\n\nfunction  calcFib(num) {\n\nif (num \u003c=  1) return  1;\n\nreturn  calcFib(num -  1) +  calcFib(num -  2);\n\n}\nreturn  calcFib(n);\n\n}, [n]); // dependency array: recalc only if `n` changes\n\nreturn \u003cdiv\u003eFibonacci number: {fib}\u003c/div\u003e;\n\n}\n```\n  \n\n## Why use useMemo here?\n\nWithout useMemo, the calcFib function  would  be  called  on  every  render, which  can  be  very  expensive  especially  for  large  n.\n\nWith  useMemo, React  caches  the  result  of  the  calculation  and  only  recomputes  it  if  n  changes, saving  CPU  time  and  improving  performance.\n\n\n# Using  useCallback  to  Memoize  Functions\n\nPassing  inline  functions  as  props  causes  child  components  to  re-render  unnecessarily  because  every  render  creates  a  new  function  reference.\n\n\nuseCallback  returns  a  memoized  version  of  the  function  that  only  changes  if  its  dependencies  change.\n\n  \n\n```jsx\n\nimport  React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';\n\nconst Button = React.memo(({ onClick, children }) =\u003e {\n\nconsole.log('Button rendered');\n\nreturn \u003cbutton  onClick={onClick}\u003e{children}\u003c/button\u003e;\n\n});\n\n\nfunction  Parent() {\n\nconst [count, setCount] =  useState(0);\n\n  \n\n// Memoize increment function to prevent new function creation on every render\n\nconst  increment  =  useCallback(() =\u003e {\n\nsetCount(c  =\u003e c +  1);\n\n}, []); // empty dependency array means function stays the same\n\n  \n\nreturn (\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCount: {count}\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cButton  onClick={increment}\u003eIncrement\u003c/Button\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n);\n\n}\n```\n\n## Why use useCallback?\n\nWithout useCallback, the increment function  would  be  recreated  on  every  render.\n\n  \n\nThis  causes  Button  to  re-render  even  if  its  props  appear  unchanged.\n\n  \n\nWith  useCallback, the  function  reference  stays  the  same  between  renders  unless  dependencies  change, so  Button  only  re-renders  when  needed.\n\n  \n\nSummary\n\n1. Use  React.memo  to  memoize  entire  functional  components  to  avoid  unnecessary  re-renders  when  props  are  unchanged.\n\n  \n\n2. Use  useMemo  to  memoize  expensive  calculations  inside  components.\n\n  \n\n3. Use  useCallback  to  memoize  functions  passed  as  props  to  prevent  unnecessary  re-creation  of  functions  and  child  re-renders.\n\n  \n\nProper  use  of  these  memoization  techniques  can  help  your  React  apps  run  faster  and  more  efficiently."},{"slug":"django-ubuntu-22-04-gunicorn-nginx","frontMatter":{"title":"Guide to Setting Up a Django Server with Nginx and Gunicorn","description":"This step-by-step guide will show you how to set up a web server for your Django app using Nginx and Gunicorn on an Ubuntu server. We'll walk you through everything from installing the necessary packages to configuring your environment to run Django in production. Let's get started!","image":"/images/blog/django.jpg","date":"2025-01-04","category":"Server"},"content":"\n\n## Preparing the Server\n\nFirst things first: we need to update your server and install the essential packages.\n\n -  Run these commands to update and install everything you need:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update \u0026\u0026 sudo apt upgrade -y\nsudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev libpq-dev nginx -y\n```\n\nHereâ€™s what each package is for:\n\n- `python3-pip`: The tool that lets you install Python packages youâ€™ll need for your app.\n    \n- `python3-venv`: Allows you to create a virtual environment for Pythonâ€”this keeps things nice and clean.\n    \n- `python3-dev`: Development headers and libraries for building Python packages.\n    \n- `libpq-dev`: Required for connecting your Django app to PostgreSQL if you're using that as your database.\n    \n-  `nginx`: This is the web server weâ€™re going to use to serve your Django app.\n\n----------\n\n### Creating the App Directory\n\nNow letâ€™s create the directory where your Django app will live and set the right permissions.\n\n1.  Make the directory:\n\n```bash\nsudo mkdir -p /var/www/domain.com/app\n```\n2.  Set the correct permissions:\n\n```bash\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/domain.com/app\nsudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/domain.com\n``` \nWhatâ€™s happening here:\n-   `mkdir -p`: Makes sure all the necessary folders are created (even the ones in the path).\n  \n-   `chown`: Changes the ownership of the directory to the current user (you).\n  \n-  `chmod`: Ensures the right read/execute permissions for the directory.\n\n----------\n\n### Configuring Nginx for Your App\n\nNow itâ€™s time to set up Nginx to serve your Django app. Letâ€™s create a configuration file for your domain.\n\n1.  Create the config file:\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/domain.com\n```\n\n2.  Add the following content to the file:\n\n\n```bash\n`server {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name domain.com www.domain.com;\n\n    root /var/www/domain.com/html;\n    index index.html;\n\n    location / {\n        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;\n    }\n}` \n```\nWhatâ€™s happening here:\n -   `listen 80`: Tells Nginx to listen for HTTP traffic on port 80 (the standard for web traffic).\n    \n -   `server_name`: This specifies which domains Nginx should handle with this config.\n   \n -  `try_files`: It checks if the requested files exist. If not, it returns a 404 error.\n\n----------\n\n### Setting Up SSL with Let's Encrypt\n\nFor added security, you should use HTTPS. If you donâ€™t already have an SSL certificate, Letâ€™s Encrypt is a free, trusted option.\n\n1.  First, letâ€™s redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS:\n\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name domain.com www.domain.com;\n    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n}\n```\n\n2.  Next, letâ€™s set up the HTTPS server configuration:\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl;\n    server_name domain.com www.domain.com;\n\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/fullchain.pem;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain.com/privkey.pem;\n    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;\n    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n    }\n\n    location /static/ {\n        alias /var/www/domain.com/app/static/;\n    }\n}\n``` \n\n Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s going on:\n-   `proxy_pass`: This tells Nginx to forward incoming requests to Gunicorn (which will run your Django app on port 8000).\n    \n-   `alias`: This directs Nginx to the static files folder where your Django app will store its static assets.\n\n----------\n\n### Activating the Nginx Configuration and Restarting the Service\n\nNow that weâ€™ve got Nginx set up, letâ€™s activate the configuration and restart Nginx.\n\n1.  Enable the site by creating a symbolic link:\n\n```bash\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/domain.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` \n```\n\n2.  Check for configuration errors:\n```bash\nsudo nginx -t\n```\n\n3.  If everything checks out, restart Nginx:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart nginx\n```\n\n----------\n\n## Setting Up the Django Project\n\nNext, letâ€™s get your Django project set up and ready to go!\n\n1.  Create a virtual environment for Python:\n\n```bash\ncd /var/www/domain.com/app\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate \n```\n\n2.  Install Django and Gunicorn:\n\n```bash\npip install django gunicorn \n```\n\n----------\n\n### Creating the Django Project\n\n1.  Now, letâ€™s create a new Django project:\n\n```bash\ndjango-admin startproject myproject .\n```\n\n2.  To test that everythingâ€™s running, start the Django development server:\n\n```bash\npython3 manage.py runserver\n```\n\n----------\n\n### Configuring Static Files\n\n1.  Create the static files directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p /var/www/domain.com/app/static\n```\n\n2.  Update `settings.py` to point to the correct location for static files:\n\n\n```bash\nSTATIC_ROOT = \"/var/www/domain.com/app/static/\"\nSTATIC_URL = \"/static/\"\n```\n\n3.  Collect all the static files:\n```bash\npython manage.py collectstatic\n```\n-----------\n#### In Django, handling static filesâ€”like CSS, JavaScript, and imagesâ€”requires special attention because of how static content is served in production versus development. Letâ€™s break it down:\n\nWhy Static Files Need Configuration ?\n\nBy default, Django is optimized for development, and during development, it automatically serves static files using its built-in development server. However, this approach isn't suitable for production due to performance and security concerns. Instead:\n\nIn Development:\n\n   - Django's development server (e.g., when you run python manage.py runserver) handles static files directly, pulling them from the STATICFILES_DIRS or app-specific static folders (\u003capp_name\u003e/static).\nYou don't need to create or configure STATIC_ROOT or manually run collectstatic.\n\nIn Production:\n\n   - A web server like Nginx or Apache should serve static files. This ensures better performance since serving static assets isnâ€™t what Djangoâ€™s application server (like Gunicorn) is designed for.\nDjango needs all static files from various apps to be gathered into a single directory, specified by STATIC_ROOT. This is why the collectstatic command is necessary.\nWithout a properly set STATIC_ROOT, you can't collect and serve static files efficiently in production.\n\nWhy Create the Directory Manually?\n\n   - The directory defined by STATIC_ROOT (e.g., /var/www/domain.com/app/static/) is where Django collects all static files when you run:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py collectstatic\n```\n\nYou need to create this directory manually because:\n\n1. It's not automatically created by Django: Django only expects the STATIC_ROOT setting to point to an existing location.\n  \n2. Flexibility in deployment: You might want the static directory to be in a specific location, independent of Djangoâ€™s project structure. For example, /var/www/... is commonly used in production setups.\n   \nDo You Need This in Both Production and Development?\n   - In Production: Yes, always. The STATIC_ROOT directory and the collectstatic process are essential in production environments because Django doesnâ€™t serve static files directly. Instead, the web server (e.g., Nginx) will use the collected files.\n   - In Development: Not typically. Django's development server handles static files automatically using the STATICFILES_DIRS and app-specific static folders. You don't need to configure STATIC_ROOT or run collectstatic.\n\nIf you're testing a production-like environment locally, you might set it up in development to mirror production, but itâ€™s optional.\n\n#### Key Takeaway\n\nThe manual creation of the STATIC_ROOT directory and running collectstatic are production-specific requirements. In development, Django simplifies the process, but in production, separating the app logic from static file serving is critical for performance and scalability.\n\n-----------\n4.  Set the right permissions on the static files folder:\n\n```bash\nsudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/domain.com/app/static\nsudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/domain.com/app/static\n```\n\n\n\n### Setting Up the Gunicorn Service\n\nGunicorn will serve your Django app, so letâ€™s set it up with a systemd service.\n\n1.  Create the Gunicorn service file:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service\n```\n\n2.  Add the following configuration:\n\n```bash\n[Unit]\nDescription=gunicorn daemon for Django project\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nUser=www-data\nGroup=www-data\nWorkingDirectory=/var/www/domain.com/app\nExecStart=/var/www/domain.com/app/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 127.0.0.1:8000 myproject.wsgi:application\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\n3.  Check the permissions:\n\n```bash\nls -l /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service\n```\n\nIf the permissions need fixing:\n\n```bash\nsudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service\n```\n\n----------\n\n### Starting the Gunicorn Service\n\n1.  Enable and start Gunicorn:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl start gunicorn\nsudo systemctl enable gunicorn\n```\n\n\n2.  To check that everythingâ€™s working:\n\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl status gunicorn\n``` \n\n----------\n\nAnd thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ve successfully set up your Django app with Nginx and Gunicorn. Your app is now ready to handle traffic in production, and youâ€™ve ensured itâ€™s secure and performant.

Spoiler alert: thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all answer, but donâ€™t worryâ€”Iâ€™ve got you covered. Letâ€™s break it all down in simple terms and help you make the call!","image":"/images/blog/ssrvscsr.jpg","date":"2024-12-31","category":"Server"},"content":"\n\nHey there, tech fan! ðŸ‘‹\n\n## Whatâ€™s the Deal with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?\n\nAlright, hereâ€™s the lowdown: SSR means your server does the heavy lifting. When someone visits your site, the server sends them a fully-formed, ready-to-go HTML page.\n\nWhy SSR is Still Cool in 2025 ?\n1. Fast Initial Loads: Your users see the content right away. No waiting around for JavaScript to do its thing. Perfect for folks on slow connections (looking at you, spotty coffee shop Wi-Fi).\n2. SEO Heaven: If youâ€™re building something like a blog, news site, or an online store, SSR makes sure Google can actually see your content. More visibility = more traffic = more mony.\n3. Universal Access: Got users with older browsers or limited JS support? SSRâ€™s got their back.\n\nWhatâ€™s the Catch?\n   - Your serverâ€™s gonna feel the heat. Every request means work, so scalability can be tricky.\n   - Dynamic stuff (like those fancy widgets you love) needs extra JavaScript to stay interactive.\n\n## What About Client-Side Rendering (CSR)?\n\nNow, CSR flips the script. The server hands your browser some basic HTML and JavaScript, and the browser takes over, building the page right in front of the userâ€™s eyes.\n\nWhy CSR is the Life of the Party\n1. Smooth \u0026 Interactive: CSR shines when youâ€™ve got a lot of dynamic, clicky stuff going onâ€”think admin dashboards or real-time chat apps.\n2. Server-Friendly: Your server can chill while the browser does most of the work. Good for apps with tons of users.\n3. App-Like Vibes: Fast transitions, no page reloadsâ€”it feels like a native app.\n\nThe Downsides?\n1. That initial load can feel sloooow. Users on weaker connections might see a blank page before everything kicks in.\n2. Search engines arenâ€™t always thrilled with JavaScript-heavy sites, so youâ€™ll need extra tools to keep them happy.\n\n## Why Not Both? (Hint: You Totally Can)\n\nHereâ€™s the good news: in 2025, you donâ€™t have to pick a side. Hybrid solutions are where itâ€™s at, thanks to frameworks like Next.js, Blazor, and SvelteKit. Let me drop some buzzwords for you:\n\nStatic Site Generation (SSG)\n\nYour pages are pre-built and served super-fast. Great for stuff that doesnâ€™t change every five seconds, like portfolio sites or blogs.\n\nIncremental Static Regeneration (ISR)\n\nImagine getting all the benefits of static pages, but with the ability to update them dynamically as needed. This oneâ€™s perfect for online stores or any site with frequently updated content.\n\nPartial Hydration\n\nOnly load JavaScript for the interactive parts of the page. The rest stays snappy and server-rendered. Modern magic, am I right?\n\n## Soâ€¦ How Do You Choose?\n\nHereâ€™s the cheat sheet:\n\nGo SSR if you need:\nLightning-fast initial page loads.\n\nTop-notch SEO for your content.\n\nA global audience with mixed tech setups.\n\nGo CSR if you need:\n\nA super interactive, app-like feel.\n\nReal-time data updates (think dashboards).\n\nTo scale for lots of users without overloading your servers.\n\nGo Hybrid if you want the best of both worlds. Seriously, itâ€™s 2025â€”why compromise?\n\n## Real-Life Examples\n\nHereâ€™s how Iâ€™d play it:\n\nSSR for Blogs and News Sites: Imagine dropping a new blog post about the best coffee spots in California. You want that to load fast and rank high on Google. SSRâ€™s your bestie here.\n\nCSR for Dashboards: Building a project management app for your startup? CSRâ€™s smooth interactivity is exactly what you need.\nHybrid for E-Commerce: Got a shop selling handcrafted surfboards? Use SSR for product pages (SEO gold!) and CSR for that interactive shopping cart.\n\n\n## Wrap-Up: SSR vs. CSRâ€”Who Wins?\n\nThe real winner? Your users. Picking the right approach depends on what youâ€™re building and who youâ€™re building it for. The cool thing is, frameworks in 2025 make it easier than ever to mix and match.\n\nStill on the fence? Hit me up in the comments, or check out tools like Next.js, Blazor, or Astroâ€”theyâ€™re game changers.\n\nAlright, thatâ€™s it for today! Now go out there and build something amazing.

A kubeconfig file will be generated and can be found at /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml.\n\nStep 2: Get the Token\nTo add worker nodes, youâ€™ll need the token generated during installation. Retrieve it with:\n\n```bash\ncat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token\n```\n\nStep 3: Add Worker Nodes\nOn each worker node, install K3s and connect it to the master:\n```bash\ncurl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://\u003cMASTER_IP\u003e:6443 K3S_TOKEN=\u003cTOKEN\u003e sh -\n```\n\nStep 4: Verify the Cluster\nOn the master node, verify the connected nodes:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get nodes\n```\n\n## Testing the Cluster\nTo confirm that your cluster is working correctly, deploy a simple application:\n\n```bash\nkubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx\nkubectl expose deployment nginx --type=NodePort --port=80\n```\n\nFind the exposed port using:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get services\n```\nAccess the application at http://\u003cNODE_IP\u003e:\u003cPORT\u003e.\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues in Kubernetes Clusters\n\nEven with a solid Kubernetes setup, issues are bound to arise. Here are some of the most common problems and how to address them effectively:\n\n1. DNS Issues in MicroK8s\nIf DNS isnâ€™t working:\n  - Check if CoreDNS is running:\n```bash\nmicrok8s kubectl get pods -n kube-system\n```  \n\n  - If it's in CrashLoopBackOff, check the logs:\n```bash \nmicrok8s kubectl logs -n kube-system \u003ccoredns-pod-name\u003e  \n```\n\n  - Ensure that iptables isnâ€™t blocking DNS traffic:\n```bash\nsudo iptables -F  \n```\n\n2. Worker Nodes Not Connecting in K3s\nIf a worker node isnâ€™t showing up in kubectl get nodes:\n\n   - Verify that youâ€™re using the correct URL and token from the master node:\n```bash\ncat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token  \n```\n\nOpen port 6443 on the master node:\n```bash\nsudo ufw allow 6443/tcp\n```\n3. Service Inaccessible\nIf your applications are unreachable:\n\n  - Check the NodePort for your service:\n```bash\nkubectl get services\n```\n  - Ensure readiness probes are properly configured:\n```bash\nkubectl describe pod \u003cpod-name\u003e  \n```\n\n  - Open the NodePort range (30000-32767):\n```bash\nsudo ufw allow 30000:32767/tcp  \n```\n\n4. Cluster Nodes in â€˜NotReadyâ€™ State\nIf nodes are marked as NotReady:\n\n   - Check hardware resources:\n```bash\nfree -h\n```\n\n  - Make sure the container runtime (e.g., Docker/Containerd) is running:\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart docker\n```\n\n   - Reinstall networking plugins:\n```bash\nmicrok8s enable dns flannel  \n```\n\n5. Pods Stuck in Pending State\nWhen pods canâ€™t be scheduled:\n\n   - Inspect events for the pod:\n```bash\nkubectl describe pod \u003cpod-name\u003e  \n```\n\n   - Remove unnecessary taints from nodes:\n```bash\nkubectl taint nodes \u003cnode-name\u003e key=value:NoSchedule-  \n```\n\nThese tips will help you quickly diagnose and resolve most Kubernetes cluster issues. The key is to dive into logs and system events to pinpoint where things are breaking down. Good luck!

With the power of Docker, you can easily run Apache in an isolated container, making your setup portable and quick to deploy. In this blog post, we will walk you through the steps to install and run Apache on Ubuntu 22.04 using Docker. This setup is perfect for testing, development, or production environments.\n\n## What You'll Learn.\n\n\nIn this guide, you'll learn:\n\n1.  How to install Docker on Ubuntu 22.04.\n2.  How to pull and run Apache in a Docker container.\n3.  Basic management of your Apache Docker container.\n4.  How to troubleshoot any potential issues during the setup.\n\n## Step 1 Install Docker on Ubuntu 22.04\n\nBefore we begin setting up Apache, we need to ensure that Docker is installed on your system. Docker allows us to run Apache within a container, providing a lightweight and efficient environment. Follow these steps to get Docker up and running:\n\n1.1 Update Your System\n\nStart by updating your package lists to make sure youâ€™re working with the latest versions of the software.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade -y\n```\n\n1.2 Install Required Dependencies\n\nNext, weâ€™ll install some necessary dependencies to allow Docker to be added to the system.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common\n```\n\n1.3 Add Dockerâ€™s Official GPG Key\n\nNow, you need to add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key to your system so it can verify the Docker package authenticity.\n\n\n**curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg**\n\n1.4 Add Dockerâ€™s Repository\n\nAdd Dockerâ€™s official repository to your systemâ€™s list of sources, so you can install the latest version of Docker from it.\n\n\n**echo \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list \u003e /dev/null**\n\n\n1.5 Install Docker\n\nNow you can install Docker. After updating your package list, install Docker using the following command:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io\n```\n\n1.6 Verify Docker Installation\n\nTo confirm Docker was installed successfully, check the version of Docker installed:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker --version\n```\n## Step 2 Run Apache in a Docker Container\n\nNow that Docker is installed, it's time to pull the official Apache image and run it in a container. Docker makes it incredibly easy to run a fully functional Apache web server without the need to configure anything manually.\n\n2.1 Pull the Official Apache Image\n\nDocker Hub has a ready-to-use official Apache image, so you don't have to create one from scratch. Pull the image by running:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker pull httpd\n```\n2.2 Run Apache in a Docker Container\n\nWith the Apache image pulled, we can now run it in a container. This will start Apache and bind it to your machine's port 8080:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name apache-server httpd\n```\n-d: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).\n-p 8080:80: Maps port 80 inside the container (the default Apache port) to port 8080 on your host machine.\n--name apache-server: Names your container \"apache-server\" for easy reference.\n\n2.3 Verify the Apache Container is Running\n\nTo check if your container is running properly, you can use:\n```bash\nsudo docker ps\n```\nThis command will list all running containers, and you should see your apache-server container in the list.\n\n2.4 Access Apache in Your Browser\n\nNow, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 or http://\u003cyour-server-ip\u003e:8080 (if you're working on a remote machine). You should see the default Apache welcome page, which indicates that Apache is running inside the Docker container.\n\n## Step 3 Managing Your Apache Docker Container\n\nOnce your Apache server is running, you may need to perform some basic container management tasks. Here are some useful commands:\n\n3.1 Stop the Apache Container\n\nIf you need to stop the Apache container, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker stop apache-server\n```\n3.2 Start the Apache Container Again\n\nTo start the container again after stopping it:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker start apache-server\n```\n\n3.3 Remove the Apache Container\n\nIf you want to remove the container (for example, when cleaning up), use this command:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker rm apache-server\n```\n3.4 View Apache Logs\n\nTo view the logs generated by Apache inside the container:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker logs apache-server\n```\n\n## Step 4 Customize Your Apache Setup\n\nAt this point, you have Apache running in Docker with its default configuration. However, Docker allows for greater flexibility, enabling you to configure Apache further. You can mount configuration files or a custom website directory into your container, or even create a custom Dockerfile to suit your specific needs.\n\n4.1 Mounting Local Directories to Docker\n\nIf you want to serve your custom website, you can mount your local directory to the Apache container:\n```bash\nsudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v /path/to/your/website:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ --name apache-server httpd\n```\nThis command mounts the website directory on your host machine to the htdocs folder in the Apache container, where Apache looks for files to serve.\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\nDocker Image Pull Failures: Ensure you have a stable internet connection. If you encounter issues while pulling the Apache image, try running docker system prune to clear unused data and try again.\nPort Conflicts: If port 8080 is already in use, you can change the host port (e.g., -p 8081:80) when running the container.\nApache Errors: To check for any issues with Apache itself, use docker logs apache-server to view the container's log output.\n\n## Conclusion\nCongratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully set up Apache on Ubuntu 22.04 using Docker. This method is a clean and efficient way to run a web server, with the added benefits of Dockerâ€™s portability and ease of use. You can now scale your Apache setup, customize it, or even deploy it in production with minimal effort. Docker makes managing your server environments a breeze, and using Apache in a containerized environment is a powerful choice for modern web hosting.\n\nIf you want to take it a step further, you can integrate Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications or even link Apache with a MySQL or PHP container for dynamic website hosting.\n\nHappy coding, and enjoy your new Apache web server!"},{"slug":"cerbot","frontMatter":{"title":"How to Install and Use Let's Encrypt SSL on Your Server (Apache \u0026 Nginx)","description":"Certbot is the recommended client for obtaining and renewing SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt. The installation process depends on your Linux distribution (or operating system), but the following steps are for Ubuntu. The process is similar for other distributions.","image":"/images/blog/cerbot.jpg","date":"2024-12-20","category":"Server"},"content":"\nLetâ€™s Encrypt uses Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol to automate the process of obtaining and installing SSL certificates. The most common ACME client is Certbot, which is responsible for obtaining the certificates from Letâ€™s Encrypt and configuring the server.\n\nLetâ€™s Encrypt certificates are domain-validated certificates, meaning they only verify the ownership of the domain and not the identity of the organization behind it. This is why they are ideal for personal blogs, small businesses, or any website that doesnâ€™t require extended validation (EV) certificates.\n\n## Install Certbot\n## On Ubuntu/Debian.\nUpdate existing packages:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\n```\n## Install Certbot and the plugin for Nginx or Apache (depending on your web server):\n\nFor Nginx:\n```bash\nsudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx\n```\n\nFor Apache:\n```bash\nsudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache\n```\n\n## On CentOS/RHEL.\nInstall EPEL repository (for CentOS 7 and below):\n\n```bash\nsudo yum install epel-release\n```\n\n\nInstall Certbot:\n\n```bash\nsudo yum install certbot python2-certbot-nginx\n```\n## Obtain the SSL Certificate\nAfter installation, you can obtain an SSL certificate for your domain. Certbot will automatically check if your domain is configured correctly and request the certificate from Let's Encrypt.\n\nFor Nginx:\n```bash\nsudo certbot --nginx\n```\n\nFor Apache:\n```bash\nsudo certbot --apache\n```\nCertbot will ask you to enter your email address and accept the terms and conditions. It will then automatically verify your domain and configure the web server to use the SSL certificate.\n\nSet Up Automatic Certificate Renewal\nLet's Encrypt certificates are valid for only 90 days. Itâ€™s important to set up automatic renewal.\n\nCertbot includes a cron job to handle automatic renewals, but you can check it by running:\n\n```bash\nsudo certbot renew --dry-run\n```\nThis simulates the renewal process and will show you if everything is working fine.\n\n## Check the Installation\nOnce you've configured Let's Encrypt, you can check that SSL is working by accessing your site using https:// in front of your domain. You can also verify with an online tool like SSL Labs.\n\nConfigure HTTP to HTTPS Redirection\nTo ensure that all visitors to your site are using HTTPS, you should redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. If you used the Certbot plugin for Nginx or Apache, it will automatically configure this redirection.\n\n\n1. For Nginx:\n\nExample of SSL Configuration in Nginx (yourdomain.com.conf):\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;\n    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n}\n\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl;\n    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;\n\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;\n\n    location / {\n        root /var/www/yourdomain;\n        index index.html index.php; #etc\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nIn the server block configuration (usually /etc/nginx/sites-available/default), add a section for HTTP to HTTPS redirection:\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;\n    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n}\n```\n\n2. For Apache:\n\nIn your Apache configuration file (located in /etc/apache2/sites-available/), ensure thereâ€™s a VirtualHost block for HTTPS (port 443) and an HTTP to HTTPS redirection block.\n\nExample of SSL Configuration in Apache (default-ssl.conf):\n\n```bash\n\u003cVirtualHost *:443\u003e\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@yourdomain.com\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/yourdomain\n    ServerName yourdomain.com\n    ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com\n\n    SSLEngine on\n    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem\n    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem\n    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/chain.pem\n\n    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\n    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n\n    # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS\n    \u003cIfModule mod_rewrite.c\u003e\n        RewriteEngine On\n        RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off\n        RewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]\n    \u003c/IfModule\u003e\n\u003c/VirtualHost\u003e\n\n```\n\nThen enable SSL and the default-ssl site configuration:\n\n```bash\nsudo a2enmod ssl\nsudo a2ensite default-ssl\nsudo systemctl restart apache2\n\n```\nAdd this rule in your .htaccess file or Apache configuration:\n\n```bash\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} off\nRewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]\n```\n\n\nPeriodically Check Certificates\nSetting up and using Let's Encrypt SSL certificates is a straightforward process with Certbot, ensuring that your website traffic is encrypted and secure. Whether you're using Apache or Nginx, this guide provides the necessary steps to configure SSL and redirect HTTP to HTTPS.\n\nBy regularly checking your SSL certificates and ensuring automatic renewals, you can maintain a secure and trusted website for your visitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog","query":{},"buildId":"vzfPQ58enumHgUufOomOo","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
